Egglog 3 - Untangling an Unknot with Category Theory



I've been tinkering along havin a grand ole time.

- Made Multipatterns generic
- Used clap to make the cli
- Used rustyline to add in a basic repl
- Added include directives for multiple files
- Experimented more


I've returned to the more equational axiomatization of 

- The proof production in principle will give you a method by which to untangle the knot. A method to entangle a knot is the most obvious form of proof of unknottedness.
- A module system? I need something compile time to organize things. Macros, modules, proof scripts? Something.
