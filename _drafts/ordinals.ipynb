    "# Ordinals\n",
    "The ordinals are one possible generalization of the natural numbers to include infinities. In particular, they focus on the property of the naturals that they are totally ordered and that counting down with naturals always has to stop/terminate. In more technical words, the inequality relation on naturals is a well order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinals are reasonable mathematical model of the concept of enumeration extended to the infinite. Cardinals are a reasonable extension of the notion of size. That these do not coincide in the infinite as they do in the finite is somewhat surprising, but the infinite is a surprising place.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ordinals are sometimes constructed in the context of set theory as transitive sets. This construction is useful but also somewhat artificial. The same construction is how the naturals are encoded in set theory. This construction is not at all the source of intuition or the platonic realness of the naturals, and we shouldn't expect it to be for the ordinals either.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also keep in mind the complexity which is hidden by python having a built in integer type. Computers implement arithemtic using binary, in other words by representing numbers as a sum of powers of 2. For example, `9 = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^3 = 0b1001`. If we had to spell this out we could represent ordinary numbers as tuples of booleans. Arithmetic is perfectly computable, but kind of a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cantor normal form of ordinals can be thought of as a \"base $\\omega$\" expansion of an ordinal, so we should anticipate at least as much complication as binary expansions of . A difference is that instead of having powers of the base be whole numbers, we extend powers to also be ordinals themselves (since ordinals are one possible extension of whole numbers). \n",
