Maximal Munch


# Graph Coloring and Register Allocation

The interference graph has an edge between any two variables that are live at the same time.
Live means that the variable  has been made and someone still needs to use it now or later.


Liveness via datalog.





# Instruction Scheduling





Dataflow analysis with Datalog.
I should lay out what I understand of the unison compiler.
