# Rewrite Rules, Guards, and Horn Clauses

# Monotonicity, Lattices, and Saturation

# Multipatterns
Distinction from this notion

# Queries

# Datalog

# Implementation

# Interesting Examples
## Injectivity
## Uniqueness quantification
## Type derivations

## Comparison with SMT solvers, Prolog, those CHR things

# Future Work

How to internalize Analysis, Extraction
Proofs
Efficient implementation
Magic Set
