Hike Mt. WhiteFace - Early May
Extremely rainy first day that we hung out in camp. The wind ripped apart two different tarps we set up to protect us. The debate on how to setup said tarps was excruciating. First camp trip where Declan brought Goose. Had nice breakfast  was a sassy diner waitress. I like breakfast. Saw a moose cross the road on our drive in the campsite. Next day went on hike up Mt. Whiteface. Quite nice, 'cept my bell kind of hurt. I slipped off a log crossing a river and slammed my ear really good. I was deaf in it for a good 15 mins. Talked the the people in charge of the site. Cool little commune situation. Bee keepers.
