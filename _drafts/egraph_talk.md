A rosette stone: Egraphs as ground rewrite systems

The egraph itself is a compact representation of a system of ground equations over terms

Completion is a methodology to do automated reasoning over equations

Fact: Ground completion is guaranteed to terminate (under the appropriate term order)

Tree Automata. It has been noted that egraphs are tree automata. tree automata themselves can be represented as ground rewrite systems.
Noting that egraphs are ground rewrite systems is an observation in the same vein, with close to the same content. I find it subjectively find it conceptually superior in that rewrite systems are closely related to the task of equational reaosning, whereas tree automata are couched in the language of automata theory, a more unfamiliar entity.
