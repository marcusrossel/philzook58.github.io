    "At noon, I promised several classmates couple references in Kleene Algebra. I figure I would write a list of KA literature, mainly in applications (yet, still a lot of math :the_horns: ), with some paper about meta-theories at the end :face_with_monocle: . Hopefully it is helpful to others.\n",
