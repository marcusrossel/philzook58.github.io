    "## What are Union Finds?\n",
    "A union find is a forest of equivalence classes. Each tree in the forest is one equivalence class. The children point up to the parents for a fast `find` operation to get a canonical member (the root) of each eq class.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are they for? Well, one use case is to find the connected components in an undirected graph. This is used as part of Kruskal's algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm for finding minimum spanning forests of a graph. You consider the edges in weight order greedily and add it to the spanning tree if it doesn't connect two thing already connected. The union find gives a fast check for already connected.\n",

    "If you only assert equations of the form `x - y = 0` aka have rows in your matrix of only a single `1` and `-1`, then the reduced row echelon form will tell you exactly wich variables are equal to a canonical vairable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our graph was a bunch of points connected by springs, these eigvenctors are normal mods that correspond to an entire connected chunk translating uniformly. Or you could think of the graph as a circuit and the edges as resistors in which case it corresponds to the shifting of an entire chunk by a uniform Voltage, and no current flows.\n",
