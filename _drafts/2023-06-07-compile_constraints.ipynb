My 10cent discussion of VLIW is that the instruction set allows explicit specification of parallelism / data dependencies. This enables perhaps a more direct model of the actual parallel interworkings of the cpu at the cost of significant compiler complexity. It is here that perhaps constraint compilation carries its weight.\n",

    "LLVM has multiple IRs. One of them is [Machine IR](https://llvm.org/docs/MIRLangRef.html) (MIR), which is an IR that has more of the information filled in. Unison takes this output, fiddles with it, and then performs solving. This reuses the frontend, middle end passes, and instruction selection of llvm, which is huge.\n",
