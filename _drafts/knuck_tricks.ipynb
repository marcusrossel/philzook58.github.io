    "# Z3 Expressions Types\n",
    "A design principle I've narrowed in on is piggy packing on the z3 AST datatypes for my theorem datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was toying with making my own first order logic / higher order logic AST in python and then interpreting it into Z3. So far, I think this is an unnecessary indirection and was just burning time, lines of code, and design energy to no benefit. Z3 already has a feature rich access api and maybe the only thing I would have added to my type is built in polymorphism/sort generics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the benefit that if you know how to write z3 python, you know how to write knuckeldragger. If you know smtlib, you know knuckledragger. And regardless of the fate of knuckledragger, these are useful skills.\n",

By restricting our logic to more or less what the solvers already offer, we get a lot of distance and usability for free. The less code I write the better\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a lot of experience using z3 to model problems in python. I like it. However, there is a need to break it up. Z3 does not have a mechanism to distinguish between theorems to be proved and theorems proven.\n",

    "We can model Naturals using an algebraic datatype consisting of a zero and successor constructor  `type nat = Zero | Succ of nat`. \n",

    "\n",
    "You need to define an induction principle, more on how to do this generally later. For Nats it's easy to do by hand as an axiom schema (an axiom parametrized by data, in this case the data is a python or z3 lambda specifying a predicate `P`)\n",

I think here, permutations on the integers (a subset of Nat -> Nat) is an interesting and rich Universe in which we can embed all countable groups (The content of the Cayley representation). All finite groups are isomorphic to some subset of this object. This is a metafact which maybe we can't express, because what exactly _is_ a group in the first place?

    "For example `even(x) = exists y, x == 2*y`. However, there is an obvious definition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lambdas\n",
    "Use lambdas sparingly and defunctionalize immediately. You will be surprised by what things about lambdas z3 will understand and won't. It can normalize lambdas, but don't count on much beyond that. Perhaps when I have better support for using Vampire or Eprover I can amend this suspicion of using lambdas.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've complained before that python doesn't have a good lambda manipulation library. Well, actually, z3 is not a bad version of that really. It has enough functionality that a locally nameless open_binder combinator is easy to write. Be forewarned, alpha equivalent lambdas are not `eq`.\n",

    "    ]\n",
    "    return vars, z3.substitute_vars(lam.body(), *vars)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Induction\n",
    "Don't have a great answer. I have built wrappers around the z3 Datatype mechanism to derive induction and recursion definitions. Not in love with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Relations\n",
    "A useful modelling capability is inductive relations, which are served by dependent type definitions in systems like lean and coq.\n",
    "Dependent types are not necessary for some version of inductive relations though.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my Justified SMT post, I discussed the basic idea of how I intend to encode this. You can use the clark completion to define all the ways a relation can become true. If you add an extra parameter to the relation that describes the tree and existential witnesses of the proof, these become well founded relations. Induction over the relation is really induction over this proof object.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are related to refinements in that we need an extra consistency condition that the proof object attached to the relation actually checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generics\n",
    "A big problem for smtlib is that you can't easily write sort generic/polymorphic definitions.\n",
    "This can be got around by writing generic functions/definitions such that they take in the z3 sort as a parameter to a python function. This is analogous to using a module system to achieve \n",
    "\n",
    "Another intriguing option is the addition of an open or closed `Any` universe. One can define a datatype `ClosedAny` or declare an uninterpreted sort `OpenAny` that has injectors and projectors from all other types. Things that have to be generic can work over this type sometimes. Without auto conversions, this may be rather clunky. It is interesting the relationship between this Any type and type theory universes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "It would be nice sometimes to not have to keep repeating `ForAll([x], foo, bar, biz)` all the time and keep some lemmas in the `by` clause by default. One solution is to make local lemma wrappers. Could do something trickier or more stateful though. Not sure\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def local_lemma(thm,by=[]):\n",
    "    return kd.lemma(kd.QForAll([x], foo, bar, thm), by=by + [my_default_lemma])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algebraic Hierarchy\n",
    "An interesting and tough problem is building algebraic hierarchies in your system. The theories of monoids, groups, rings, fields, etc have a relation to one another. This relation is a quite possibly complicated partial order and there may be more than one may to interpret the naturals as a group for example. There are other less algebraic examples such as different strengths of continuity or differentiability in analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I spent a bit of time thinking about this. It's tough and seemingly tied to generics. So far, it looks like it would require building a lot of metasystem in python. I'm punting on this one. Let's prove some concrete things before worrying about how to abstract them. I suspect the generic weakness of knuckledragger means it will never have an awesome solution to this problem. It's like trying to model Lean in C. You can probably do it in some sense, but at extreme encoding cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quotients\n",
    "One thing the Lean folks claim is a big deal is that Lean has a culture of supporting quotients, possibly even in the core system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quotients do exist and are useful. They feel dual in some way to the problems of refinements\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- canon function.\n",
    "- Sets of equal elements\n",
    "- By fiat declare new undefined quotient sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z/2 is kind of the quotient analog of even/odd\n",
    "\n",
    "## ite chains\n",
    "It is unfortunate that the z3 python bindings do not offer a pattern matching construct even though the surface language of smtlib2 does. Big nested sequences of `If` are ugly, hard to read, and hence easy to get wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/expressions/api/polars.when.html The dataframe ecosystem has a convention to solve a similar problem. I'm trying to use familiar python idioms when one can work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could do purely functional chaining or stateful. I'm kind of offering both here by returning `self`.\n",

    "\n",
    "One possibility to sanity check the totality of your cases is to put a fresh variable in the otherwise and then do a relational check `prove(e1 == e2)` where `e1` and `e2` only differ by the fresh constant in the otherwise default case. If this check does not pass, your cases are not total. And you can achieve this without going to a Maybe or keeping aside some other special error value. Kind of cute.\n"
