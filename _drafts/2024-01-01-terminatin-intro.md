title: Introduction to Termination Checkers
---

Termination is the question of whether some dynamical system will always eventually stop.
The "dyanamical system" in question is usually a term rewriting system (rules describing simplifying or evaluating exressions like `x + 0 -> x` or `append(cons(a,x), y) -> cons(append(x,y))`). The state here is the current term and the dynamics are described by the rules. There are an infinite number of posssible terms/states to consider here. What is there to do?

An old notion of termination is that of a fixed point. The differential equation `y' = -y` has solutions $y = C e ^ {-x}$. We can see that this is a decaying solution heading to `y = 0`. We could also find this fixed point by finding where `'y = 0` which mean `y = 0`.
Lyapunov functions are certificates for regions of decay.

It perhaps helps to consider a system with a finite number of states. It then is clearly more tractable to consider the question of whether a system will eventually get stuck. If we think about it, this is equivalent to just checking if there is a loop in the transition graph.

For infinite state systems the problem is more tricky. We can't exhaustively be sure there are no loops by just checking each state.

Termination is important in mathematics and program analysis. If you alow a non-terminating definition of a function into your logical system
For program analysis, if you can guarantee some loop doesn't terminate, you can ignore whatever comes after it. If you can guarantee it always terminates, you can perhaps lift code that comes after to before the loop or rearrange call sites. A guaranteed terminating piece of pure code behaves more like an ideal mathematical function and is more easy to reason and manipulate correctly. If a compiler can't reason, it is not allowed to perform optimizatins and may emit pessimistic code. This may produce better code from a compiler. Having some exact bounds of the maximum number of iterations may unlock even more. For some loops (like fixed parameter for loops) this may be very easy to do, for some nasty while loop it may not.
For verification purposes, it may be desirable to state and prove that a function always returns an answer with such and such result.

There is a class of solver called a termination checker

The core notion of a measure is some natural number that goes down and is bounded below by zero, like the length of a list. With enough squinting, other termination certificates are generalizations of this intuitive idea.

The idea of a well-founded relation is in essence trying to just define what it means for something to eventually always stop and our basic notion of something that always stops is a decreasing natural number.
