There is a cute little derivation in Sommerfeld's Lecture Volume VI: Partial Differential Equations in Physics.
The 1-d heat equation is $\partial_t T(x,t) = k \partial_x^2 T(x,t)$. It's solutions diffuse out in time.
It is intuitively surprising that the heat equation could exhibit any wavelike behavior whatsoever.

At the surface of the earth, the temperature of the seasons is approximately $T_{surf}(t) = T_{avg} + T_{year} cos(\omega_{year} t) + T_{day} \cos(\omega_{day} t)$ where $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{1 year} = \frac{2 \pi}{365 * 24 * 60 * 60 s}$.

The solution of the equation

A question remains if this is physical? Could perhaps percolation of water through the soil totally swamp this effect?

And don't even get me started on this whole "nuclear processes keep the core hot". No fucking way. You think I'll believe anything?
