title: TD4 4-bit CPU

It seems like there is a japanese book about this thing but I can't find a translation

Examining the schematic, looks like there is no ram to speak of, so this is a very limited machine. A + B + OUT + PC means there is 16 bits of state? Can easily exhaustively check this for anything you'd like. What about synthesizing programs?
Maybe this is good though
This is so constrained it feels more like a finite state machine.
Try model checking it?

Could I implement in python hdl or verilog or that gui thing?

Didn't Conor Macbride have a 4 bit cpu videos?
Are there actually 4-bit cpu ou there like this?

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-bit_computing>

What interesting programs can be written? Toughy.

Model each chip

```verilog
module ALU()

end

module ROM()
end


`def JMP 0

module Computron()
    reg [3:0] A;
    reg [3:0] B;
    reg [3:0] OUT;
    reg [3:0] PC;
    

end
```

74HC154 - Address decoder - 4 - 16 line decoder / demultiplexer. The four incoming signals are translated to 16 mutually exclusive outputs. For example in the inputs pins are LLHH will draw pin 3 of the output _low_.  Because of all the diodes, only current will flow in through the ROM switches when that bank is enabled by bing drawn low

The two enable pins are drawn down to ground so that output is always enabled.

The lines come into this decode and select which flipy floppr is drawn

74HC540 is an inverting buffer.
