title: TD4 4-bit CPU
---

It seems like there is a japanese book about this thing but I can't find a translation

Examining the schematic, looks like there is no ram to speak of, so this is a very limited machine. A + B + OUT + PC means there is 16 bits of state? Can easily exhaustively check this for anything you'd like. What about synthesizing programs?
Maybe this is good though
This is so constrained it feels more like a finite state machine.
Try model checking it?

Could I implement in python hdl or verilog or that gui thing?

Didn't Conor Macbride have a 4 bit cpu videos?
Are there actually 4-bit cpu ou there like this?

What interesting programs can be written? Toughy.
