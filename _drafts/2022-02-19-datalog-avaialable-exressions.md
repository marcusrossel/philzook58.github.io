I admit, what I'm doing here verges on ridiculous. What is probably better is to preprocess your incoming expression and jus tag them with program points. But when you need to bring in an external tool to souffle, everything becomes more complicated.


`.decl eq(l, a, b)`
vs, carrying it in the term (analogo f type tagging)
`foo(i64 context, )

:- foo(i64, ctx) ->

A uninterpeted function model of heap.

field1(obj) = 
field2(obj) = 

vs 

cons(a,b)

foo(ctx : u32, ,  )

foo(ctx ) , ctx1 <= ctx2 |- ?a = ?b
