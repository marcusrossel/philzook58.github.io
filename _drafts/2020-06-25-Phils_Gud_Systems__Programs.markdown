Sometimes I have no idea what to do with a new programming language or new ideas. Here is a brainstorm list of stuff too do.

## Phil's gud systems

Good systems for simulation and control and verification

  * 1-D Linear - Heating
  * 2-D linear. SHO. damped undamped Sliding block/free particle.
  * 4-D linear 2-SHO
  * ManyD linear - SHO chains, circuits, elastic fields
  * Pendulum
  * Double Pendulum
  * Cart pole
  * Acrobot
  * Quadrotor
  * 2D Arm planning
  * Puck World
  * Car Steering
  * Bouncing Ball - Collisional
  * Wall SHO
  * 

### Phil's gud programs

Interetsing programs to write in any language. 

  * Any of the above
  * Ray trace
  * physics engine collisions
  * lambda calc intepreter
  * particles
  * fractals
  * Kx = b
  * Fluid
  * Video games
  * Project euler
  * arithmetic evaluator

### Phil's Gud verification / Proofs

  * Fibonacci
  * List Functions - append, reverse. Pointer version vs functional version
  * Nats - commutative associative
  * Z
  * Rationals
  * Lambda calc I guess
  * cosine / sine / exp
  * Topology
  * Sorting, sort tup
  * Floating Point / Fixed Point rounding
  * Simplex / LP
  * Gaussian Elim
  * Dynamic Programming, rod cutting

  * two sort
  * sum 1 to n
  * binary search
  * integer square root
  * maximum of array
  * reduce to 0. subtract in loop until thing is 0
  * reduce integer division
