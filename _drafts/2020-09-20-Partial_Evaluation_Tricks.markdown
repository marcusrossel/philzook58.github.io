is gensym sufficient for making eigenvariables like lambdaprolog?
interp(Env, lam(B), lam(B)). % this is wrong.
interp(Env, app(F,X), R) :- interp( Env, F, lam(B)), interp(Env, X, X'), interp([ X' | Env], B, R )
interp([H | T], z, H).
interp([H | T], s(X), R) :- interp(T, X, R). % nah this ain't right. we need to do raising and lowering.

interp(Env, var(X), R) :- lookup(X, Env, R).
interp(Env, lam(X,B), lam(X,B)). % X not in Env?
interp(Env, app(F,X), R) :- interp( Env, F, lam(V,B)), interp(Env, X, X1), gensym(var, V), interp([ V-X1 | Env], B, R )

Staged logic programming is kind of like CLP. CLP collects up constraints to be solved later (at future stage).
Instead staged logic programming is collecting up constraints in the original unification language.
Can I not make new clauses? To fully do this at compile time requires that the compile time query terminates. Otherwise i need to jump between compile and runtime (which is how clp works)

interp(plus(x,y,z), q)

What I'd expect staged minikanren to look like is a minikanren that outputs minikanren clauses.
We should be able to break down at compile time minikanren programs to base unifications.
But what about things that bind to multiple results? I guess we could insert conde for as many results as there are? Or we could maintain the substitutions structure across 

 (conde (== q 3) (== q 4)) `(appendo ,q ) ==> (conde (appendo 3) (appendo 4)) 

In prolog, building code doesn't feel crazy.

What if you defunctionalize and apply the trick to the stack? going to machine and back sounds reminscent of supercompiling.
Interplay of Positive and negative.

fun x -> (4 + (x + 7))
fun x k -> 

data Stack = ToDORight Expr | 
             LeftDone Int
             | Ret



"The Trick" is  eta expansion.

Supercompilation is not like super optimizers. Super means supervise apparently. The idea I think is that you execute the program on a symbolic ish machine view all the states, and recompile that to a new program.
States themselves are kind of expressions.
Refal is very reminsicent of abstract machines and the classical logic thing, with focuses and the importance of patterns.
It is also hyper bizarre

Another possible thing is that it is partial evaluation + memoization.
Is this distinct from common subexpression collection?

Can I supercompile addition expressions? Boolean expressions?

The "trick" they call splitters and things. 

For addition, perhaps it could be nice to split unknown x as 0 or not zero. Not always useful.

partial evaluation as evaluation inference rules with some removed or staging them. It does feel kind of like the bidirectional thing. Take a system and enhance it or duplicate it with extra annotations.

Something I'm been wondering about is the relationship of symbolic execution and partial evaluation. The opaqueness of future stage code is very similar to the opaqueness of a symbolic variable. It feels like the techniques of staged metaprogramming should be useful for writing more easily verifiable code.
Loop unrolling as a staged metaprogamming thing vs unrolling for BMC
Known compile time structure unpacking
Abtract analysis boosting
CPS and ?
What if I used the ASP techniques to build parser combinators that are easily verified via Z3. In python?


But I dunno. Staged metaprogrmming example 1 is loop unrolling if the bounds of the loop are known at compile time. This is also of course what one wants to do for symbolic execution

Example 2 is sturcture unpacking if the structure is known at compile time (removing record construction destruction overhead). This is also what you want to do for symbolic evluation

Case splitting (The trick) feels like path exploration. Where you make the queries along a particular path

The First Set Last set stuff is the familiar idea of using an abstract intepretation result to boost an SMT query

CPS trasnformation and let lifting = ????

Virtual machine compiling?


Of course you want to simplify as much at compile time

Partial evaluation in Julia.

Partial evaluation is when you have a program and you supply a portion of it's arguments ahead of time.
In light of this information, there may be significant simplifications that can occur, although because of still missing arguments, the computation cannot be completely computed. The unknown input variables are blockers of computation.
You could have some arbitrary rewriting simplication system do this, but it is more principled to have this partial evaluator take a form that is systematically connected to a standard evaluator.

- Loop unrolling - If you know the bounds o the loop ahead of time
- constexpr - 
- Pattern matching - Unroll the pattern into 
- 


One way this might happen (and it is illuminating) is to consider a deeply embedded DSL where you explicitly represent the AST of your language of interest as a data type.
However there is a shallower approach available when your language offers the appropriate compile-time computation facilities.
Julia has a lisp-y quasiquoting macro system that is really neat.

If you like o think of it this way, it is that analog of string interpolation.
```julia
:( 1 +  $(2 + 3) )
# :(1 + 5)
```

#### The Power Example


## Tricks

### The Trick
A big trick is that one can convert a runtime value into a compile time value by guarding under a runtime check.
The nonobvious step in refining a program to be partially evaluatable is that you may have to insert extra runtime checks than you would ordinarily use but the payoff is that the information you gain at compile time is worth the cost of the runtime check.
In other words it is case splitting

One simple example of this is special case unrolling small n.

```julia
function foo(x::Char)
  if x > 9
  else
end


```

```julia
function foo(x::Expr)
    :(if $foo == 1
    
    
    )
end

```

Partial evaluation has some tricks

Basically

  1. Do CPS
  2. Specialize branching

Partial evluation of AExp, BExp

staged-fun. And this is already available in a friendly Haskell compiler near you.

It really helps to have a system where you can see the result of the partial evaluation. You may be surprisied by what you see. Coq is decent.  But you can also get the dump of 

The optimizations that partial evaluation achieves are also I suspect the optimization achieved by the folklore CPS transformation for making faster code. Part of the optimization an optimzing compiler _is_ partial evaluation.

Some of the things that people like to do in the type system can also (perhaps even more naturally) be done with a partial evaluation system. 

In systems like Ocaml and Haskell, the types are fully erased at runtime, so that any type level computation becomes compile time computation.

One thing that is done is to convert something into a special type by checking that it obeys teh predicate. Like taking [a] -> Maybe (Vec 10 a) needs to confirm that the length of the list is in fact 10. Then that fact is recorded for further use, inviting possible optimizations. But we can do basically the same thing. is_length_10 : code [a] -> code bool. And type vec = (int * code [a])

Like what about a  (code int, Z3.expr) as a kind of refined int type. 

Coq is from one persepctive a kind of janky restrictive Ocaml with steroidal metaprogramming capabilities. 

We can use this to perform rewrite rules. It isn't quite as straightforward as you might hope. When you perform rewrites in a proof, I'm not so clear how to get the new forms reflected back. But there is at least one trick, you can use an existential variable and then unify it at the end.

The canonical fusion is `map f . map g = map (f . g)` It avoids two passes over the same structure.  An even better fusion is build/fold fusion. If you build up a big structre just to consume it immediately, this can often be fused into 

Here are some examples using rewrite rules to fuse

    
    <code>Lemma idea2: { q : list nat -> list nat | forall l,  map S (map S (map S l)) = q l}.
    Proof. eexists. intros. Print map_map.
           (* assert  (map S (map S (map S l)) = map S (map S (map S l))). *)
           pose (map S (map S (map S l))) as opaque_lhs .
           assert (opaque_lhs =  map S (map S (map S l))).
           reflexivity. 
           rewrite map_map in H. rewrite map_map in H.  unfold opaque_lhs in H. rewrite H. auto. Defined.
    Print idea2.</code>

Recursion schemes in coq.

MetaOcaml in coq. A similar trick can be. Coq by it's nature doesn't appear to be so super concerened about efficiency differences in implementations. Things that are equal under. MetaOcaml allows controlled inlining and other partial evaluations at compile time in order to create more efficient programs that remain clearly written.

MetaCoq. Why have I not even downloaded it?

This reminds of well-typed ASTs. Sometimes those well typed asts have an explicit slot for contexts. In some sense, an introspective well typed metaprogramming langueg should reflect the surface language into a well typed ast. Pure opaqueness is a cop out. It is acceptable but not desired.
