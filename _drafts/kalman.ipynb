    "- We really don't want runtime errors liek div 0 or loop windup or overflow. Those are alarming and bad\n",
    "- We do sometimes tune and test something at one precision and want to switch to another kind of precision for all sorts of reasons. Or similarly, swap out the CPU or move to/from an fpga. Confirming that the logical behavior is identical to whatever it was before is a failry well defined question and a useful one.\n",
