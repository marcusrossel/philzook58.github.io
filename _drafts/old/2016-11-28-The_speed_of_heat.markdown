Suppose you were trying to communicate by heating the side of a steel bar. And you had a guy with a thermometer on the other end. How fast can you talk?

A nasty bit about the diffusion equation, as great and as simple as it is, is that influences at one end travel instantly to infinitely far away. The influence decays very significantly with distance, but it's there nevertheless. The theory of relativity says that can't be right. But, it is probably not right even long before that. The thing is that temperature is not infinitely precisely defined. It's a quantity that has to do with probability. Given one particle at 1000000m/s from a gas, it could hypothetically be from any temperature gas. It is mostÂ _likely_ from a gas where that is an ordinary speed, but it is not guaranteed. Temperature fluctuates.

So, once the tails of the propagating temperature diffusion wave are below this fluctuation threshold, they lose a lot of meaning.
