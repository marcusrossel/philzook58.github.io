Hi Dr Lan

I've been tinkering in the egraph community for a while.
The Twee theorem prover just so happens to dump useful information to deomnstrate my point.
It is my belief that without too much effort, automated theorem provers today could provide flexible and expressive simplification capabilities for compilers and other applications. When I use Mathemtica or sympy, I am not often stating an equality i want proven, I am giving it a big expression that I'd like a simpler form of.
Perhaps a modification of the question answering subfield of TPTP could provide a target for this capability.
