Carbon dside down because rutnrs over completely

lift out sample grids - use copper ring

two sides to nut that attaches to holder

light switch for red light

Put notch down

push until red led

second little pin once in

hold on, it sucks in

emission is 3

high tension is set to 200

press high tension for beam

watch igp stays relatively low can go up to 30 but dhould come back down

small knob is step size, large number is coarse. big knob is actual
focus. 6 i a good start

converge the beam have diffraction foucs to make diffraction rings

put in phsocpohor screen and mirror. with witch on the right side

digital micrograph

make beam not split into two

rot cetner (votage equivlanet of ht wobble)

how to do eds

smaller spot size and smaller condesnor aperture. if gu shift is off
spot size will shift beam

desktop spectrum analyzer

box behind mixroscope - press insert

make sure aperture objective is out

one click per second

push high voltage off

press end session button next to keyoad

bring second tilt back to zero, and single tilt

pull out

turn clockwise

pull it out against air pressure do it careful (STRAIGHT OUT not up)
