Identical particles.

When are particles identical

He4 atoms are identical.

How does statistics propagate upward.

1)exchange must be physically realizable. Why don't we antisymmettrize
with moon electrons?

Suppose we have atom wavefunction $\psi(R,R,r,r,r,r)$ for all neutrons
and protos and electrons.

Properly, we hsould antisymmetrize$$.

Given a set of many body wavefunctions $\psi_{i}(\{R\})$, we can take
linear sums. We can also call upon exchanged. wavefunctions. Only some
exchanges are allowable physically. That's the ordinary quantum
mechanics for the composite particle. To combine, we product and take
symmetrized sums as necessary. If sectors of the wavefunctions cannot be
unbound in the energy regime we're talking, then those coordinate can
only be exchanged as a cluster.

If we parametize our set of wavefunctions by a continuous variable
(which is not unreasonable)

An electron is only a fermion when it can become free.

Fusion rules for ordinary matter BB=B FF=B FB=F.

We need $\psi$ and possible exchange pathways.
