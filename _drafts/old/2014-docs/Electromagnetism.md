Laplace Geometry
----------------

Mean Value Propeprty - value at center of ball is average of ball.
Relaxation Method - Effectively perform diffusion equation to project
onto the 0 mode laplace solution

The planar boundary value problem for a potential takes the
$\phi=\int\phi_{s}d\Omega$

For double layers (which are the equivalent source for a BV problem), we
have the same thing. This works for magnetic scalar potentials

Why are magnets?
----------------

Dipole interaction paramagnetism model

exchange interaction

How are magnets? The scalar potential

Blast Your Face. The Key definitions
------------------------------------

$Q=CV$

$\Phi_{E}=CV$ charge= flux by gau ss

$\Phi=LI$

Quantization
------------

The canonical field is A. The canonical momentum is E.

Gauge symmettry states that

Is it possible to describe the field using something with no gauge?

Flux quanitzation

Other choices?
