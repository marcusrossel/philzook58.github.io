Nonlinear Variational parametization of mnay electron wavefunction leads
to nonlinear field parameter. Is the nonlinear field a 1-1
parametization of the many electron wavefunction (maybe fock space
wavefunction?). Implies that grassmann vairable field is somehow
variational parametero f femrionic wavefunction

Variational statistical field. The vairational parameters are actually
the parameters of the distribution, not parameteras of the field itself

$\psi(x1,x2,x3)=E[\Psi\Psi\Psi]=\int D[\Psi]\Psi\Psi\Psi P[\Psi]$

$\psi^{\dagger}\partial_{t}-H\psi\rightarrow$

$\sum_{n}z^{n}\psi_{n}^{\dagger}\partial_{t}-H\psi_{n}$ = combined
generating function of all actions. $\int e^{zS[\Psi]}P[\Psi]$

Then the particular feynman subspace of piecwise linear functions and
the distrubtion on their samples gives the path integral under
minimzation hopefully.
