Peter brought up interesting comments: Dithering and Quantization noise

1/f noise is due to random discontinuity. Shot noise?

Some Noise is not standard devioation definable

V2O5 is a Mott insulator?

indium is unusual intercalant. Kpski mentioned majorana fermions

Cherenkov might be bulk plasmon excitation

Impact parameter \<=\> Energy transfer

inelastic collisions ae always from not including motion of other guy

Double fourier transform? (two particle born?)

Four momentum might be frutiful, might not

Envelope carrier in semiclassical is addition instead of multiplication,
Add ripple wavefrton onto original wavefront

Magnetic field cylotron oscillations very similar to brillouin zone
(remove periodic aspects of dynamics). Cylcotron oscillation is
equivlanet of periodic potential (bands), with crystal momentum becing
the equivalent of movement of the gyrocenter.

Adiabatic invariants = particle path flux is conserved, gives transverse
velocity in limit of very fast oscillation
