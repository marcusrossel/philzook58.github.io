Motivation
==========

Vectors are darn useful.

Little arrows that add head to tail

One of the many generalizations of a number. In a sense they are
multinumbers, a single object consisting of many numbers

Infinite things require lots of carefulness

What is the very simplest vector space? $R$? $R^{2}$?

Banach Spaces
=============

Give the space a norm! Why not!

Extension of the idea of an absolute value on the reals. Also an
extension of the idea of size.

A couple properties

1.  $||x+y||\le||x||+||y||$

2.  $||\alpha y||=|\alpha|||y||$

3.  $||x||=0\Rightarrow x=0$

Only nothing has no size. Doubling something gives it twice the size.
the size of two things is never more than the size of them individually.

Typically the third condition is the slipperier one. Sometimes it isn't
so clear that these weird infinite spaces satisfy that.

This also induces a way of measuring how far things are from one
another, a natural metric.
