Eddy currents in infinitesimal loops - Faraday's law of induction.

The integral of the vector potential is the flux. The derivative of
vector potential is the the electric field. How convenient

only axial compoenent of A penetrates the conductor, the radial parts
are equilibriated too fast by charge layers buiulding up at surface.

Boundary conditions for A. E

Moving Medium and EMF. Including J = vxB

Eddy currents in sheets - The image method

2D Diffusion = image method

The 2d porlbem of a wire in a homgenous conducting medium. - Bessel
functions

The high resistance method: Compute fields assuming no codnuctivity,.
then see how much current would flow.

The current sheet in homgenous medium. Skin Depth. The square root of
wave problems.

How Can skin dopeth calculation concide with diffusional concepts
