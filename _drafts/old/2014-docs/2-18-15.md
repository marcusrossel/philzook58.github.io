Confromal field thoery - $e^{i\phi}$shows up as Lie gorup corresponding
to Lie algebra. The operators atv single poiunt are representation of
Lie algebra.

If you have a thoery linear in velocity $L=v\dot{q}+A\dot{q}+V(x)$, AND
we're in 2d we can find gauge that $\partial_{t}\phi=V$,
$\partial_{x}\phi=A$.

Gauge condition $\partial_{t}A=\partial_{x}V$\... hmm maybe that isn't a
good gauge condition? Isn't that E=0?

If so lagrangian and action is total derivative
$\int Ldt=\phi(b)-\phi(a)$. Wait. isn't lagnagrangian unspecified up to
total derivatives?

$<\psi\psi^{\dagger}>=e^{i\phi(b)}e^{-i\phi(a)}$.

Now if we make $\phi$ random or quantum we have to integrate this
expression.
