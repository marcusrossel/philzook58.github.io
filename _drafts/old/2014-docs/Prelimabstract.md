The microscopic nature of the 5/2 Quantum Hall state continues to be a
mystery and the possibility of a realization of a non-abelian state of
matter is tantalizing. Two Experiments \[[@key-1; @key-2]\] measured the
state dependent voltage and temperature scaling of tunneling current
between edge modes in a quantum point contact with conflicting results.
Feldman and Yang \[[@key-3]\] made the suggestion that the inclusion of
across gate Coulombic interaction may account for the discrepancy. They
suggested a smoking gun experiment of a new device designed to have a
finite region $L_{0}$ of Coulombic interaction. Such a device would show
a change of scaling behavior between that of the interacting and
non-interacting theory at temperature
$T\approx\frac{\hbar v}{k_{B}L_{0}}$ where v is the speed of the edge
mode. In an attempt to make their suggestion more explicit, the
tunneling current has been calculated including both the effects of
across-gate Coulombic interaction and finite interaction region using
the method of bosonization.
