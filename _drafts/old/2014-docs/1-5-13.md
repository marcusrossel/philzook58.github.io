The mean field

Tyhe random vairable field is

$$\rho(x)=\sum\delta(x-x_{i})$$

This field is a statisical field with all kinds of correlations (a
massive probability ditribution)

The mean field is

$$<\rho(x)>==\int d\{x_{i}\}\rho p(\{x_{i}\})=\sum\int dx_{i}p(x_{i})\delta(x-x_{i})=\sum p(x)$$

The mean field is a lumpier version regularized by the unknownness of
the

replacing the field with the mean field is hartree type apprxomatins

We can pull particles from the field and consider them sepearetly

$$p(x_{a},x_{b},\rho(x))$$
