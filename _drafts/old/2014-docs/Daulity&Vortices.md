Duality and Vortexes

We can describe the EM field via vector or scalar potentials. This is
related to the EB exchange duality.

In 2d, we can describe the electric field due to a charge as
$\nabla\phi$ or $\epsilon_{ij}\partial F$. From a scalar or "vector"
potential. Electric charge is then the core of a vortex for the vector
potential.

In the random charge model we can have any amount of charge we want on
each vertex. Maybe only integer amounts of charge? The integer amoutns
of charge are dual to an angular variable. that is restrcited from 0 to
2pi. I would almost prefer to allow continuous changes of charge.

We can use multipole expansion.

$\sum_{q}e^{-\beta H}$.

Charges are shitty for potentialsd anyhow. Its just that the "wrong"
potential needs to have shittiniess even where the charge is not. It
needs its dirac string or its cut.

Duality as a fourier transform. Fourier transfrom as a wa yof defining
delta functions. Local symmettry, if you have local symmettry then you
can write the combo of x,y as one where the local symmettry cancels out.

Duality as a generalization of G(x-y) -\> G(k). Except now instead of
translation invariance, we have gauge invaraince.

Dual equations. When one type of potential obeys one equation by
definiton and the other by dynamics and then you flip flop them.
$\nabla\times E=0$ versus $\nabla\cdot E=0$, the scalar potential and
vector potentila flip flop defintion and dynamics.

in 2d curl grad duality

in 1d derivative integral? Integral is defined up to constant c.
