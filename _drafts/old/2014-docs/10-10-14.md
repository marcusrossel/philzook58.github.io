What makes a superconductor or superfluid different?

The old school definition is the magnetic properties or the lack of
viscosity or vorticity properties.

But with squids and such, perhaps the main thing is the ability to
interfere. In some sense these states are very quantum mechanicy, which
means they interfere. (or have quantized observables)

"macroscopic of single state" what can this mean? It means that
something like that which occurs in the ideal bosonic gas model or a
pure hartree state is occuring.

Off diagnaol long range order. The denisty matrix for a pure state has
lots of off diagonal elemtns. Has big eiegenvalue.

Maybe the nonconservation term can be directly dervied from ignored
external box. A pure boson state considered in a small part of the box.
the leftover hamiltonian will not be particle conserving. Since it can
remove
