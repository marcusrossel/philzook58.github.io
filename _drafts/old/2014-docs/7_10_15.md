The quantum hall edges are capaictors.

The gate is a one end of a capaictor

$E=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}$.

Capacitance per unit length.

Trasnmission line Model

Electrostatic charging energy

Majorana Femrmions

Peirls instability + SSH

SSH and polarization. Polariztion and berry phase.

blogliboub particles = selfconsistent superconudctor

Something Instability + Kitaev

ANyons = splitting states amongst N particles

Majorana = 1 state per 2 particles
