The road to Feynman diagrams

Feynman digrams are a grpahical notation very similar to einstein
summation notation. The standard matrix notation works great until we
have a rich natural tensor/multiindex sturcture. Instead of repaenting a
matrix with a letter, we resprent it with a line. Some squiggly lines
(repsenting U particle particle interactions) are actually 2 in 2 out
index tensors. In relativistic, we typically have vertices. Vertices
rperesent conncetion points of indices and summation. Loops in digarmas
respent traces. A loop of many lines represents multi matrix products
and then a trace. Traces in continuum problems typically shit their
pants as the eigenvalues of these porblems are unbounded. Arrows on
lines are necessary if non hermitian. In fourier space, matrix
mulitplication becomes a diagonal affair.

Canonical Roads
===============

Interaction representation - quantum version of splitting movement
between distribution and variables.

The hiesenberg representation rperesents an enntire solution of the
system at once. It is the equivlaent of having a parametzied expression
for the solution of the entire system. Typically, this is impossible. We
can time evolve particular instances of starting conditions one at a
time, perhaps interpolating between them for well behaved enogh systems.
This is more schoridnger picture like.

Time Ordering. Time ordering is an obvious conseqeunce of the evolution
operator when you put it is finite step form. But then time ordering
becomes a strange kind of boundary condition that
