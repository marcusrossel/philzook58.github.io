Elastic waves in rotating (ball and spring) reference frames centrifugal
and coriolis force

The wavefunction in a wire. Thomas Fermi equation and flow of electrons
through a wire. Still have buildup. Are kinks in the wire bad?

Take fluid mechanics and integrsate of small times to get elastostatics.
Couette flow and elastic extrusion

Take piorcnpial axes of strss. Consider stress to be a web of ropes,
whenever a rope changes direction, another must alos change direction or
change magntidue.

sphgerical Voids and surplus seem like the simplest continuum mechanics
problem. The equivlaent of the coulomb problem. there will be hoop
stresses in the shells and radial stress inward. incompressible Suprlus
fixes the displacement vector at the origin (or at a sphere around the
origin)

$\int\epsilon\cdot dS$ The radial strain = $V/K$ surplus volume divided
by bulk mudlus?

Incompressible solids may however allow shear.

Dislocations in solids can appear via integrals. dislocations are like
sources for

Comptability conditions - existance of the displacement potential

COnsitutive relations for charge and current

Ohmic =\> $\sigma E=j$

Charged Fluid =\> $j=\rho v$. + momentum conservation of fluid

The dynamics of metallic objects F=vxB. How much does a hunk of metal
"carry" a current along with it as it moves? The current has a tendnecy
to persist due to the inertia of the electron flow within the metal. So
I'd say not much. Not much at all in typical situations.
