What are edge modes?

bosonization

ssh soliton transfromation

bogiubov picture can have one left moving mode?

Compare overlap of PH pfaffian, anti-pfaffian, pfaffian

The sum of pfaffian and anti-pfaffian would be ph symmetric

antipfaffian would integrate against full landau level z-z

Can I

I can build a differnetiator

Is dima's integral doable?
