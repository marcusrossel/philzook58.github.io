The gauge derivative is somewhat similar to a coviarant diervbative.
Instead of a chistroffel symbol, there is the gauge field

Motion on a cone should have a gauge derivatvie

Adiabatic approximations.

Gauge fields are one way to change boundary conditions. They are so
loosy goosy

The chsytal momenmtum is in the position of a gauge.
Consider$\psi=v(k,x)u(k(x),x)$ or $(p+k(x))^{2}+V$. COnsider the crystal
momentum wavefunction. Typically we think of the hamiltonian as being
$H=k^{2}+\epsilon_{n}(k)$, but we could instead consider The k space to
be . $H=(k+A(x))^{2}+\epsilon_{n}(k)$ Sepereation into band space and
position space. u lives in band space (fixed k). k lives in position
space. $\psi(k)$.

BornOppenheimer- Sometimes we choose to treat the nulcear motion
entirely classically, but we can also consider the motion to be quantum
(and get phonons). Apparently there is a vector potential term that
deserves to be in the nuclear hamiltonian. What if phononic loops get a
none zero loop integral. If so, I think this represents electron
pumping. This A factors into the electric current calculated in the
ionic hamiltinian.

Gauge transfromations and canonical

WKB The hamiltonian is a quite small H(x). $$\begin{array}{ccccc}
z+2+V(x) & 1\\
1 & z_{2}+2+V(x)\\
\\
\\
\\
\end{array}$$

What is to stop me from putting V as a gaguge potential

$\begin{array}{c}
\psi(x)\\
\psi'(x)
\end{array}$

a loop integral in the parameter space k,x.

Acoustic waves in moving media suffer doppler shifts. These velocities
act very similar to Magnetic fields

The theory of plasticity and gauges. Plasiticity is related to adibatic
fluid motion
