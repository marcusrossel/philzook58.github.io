Well, you poor bastard. So you've got to learn how to use the TEM.

Filling the coldtrap with Liquid Nitrogen
-----------------------------------------

How dangerous is liquid nitrogen really? Okay, so it freezes hot dogs
pretty good, but are people hot dogs?

You have to do this at the beginning of your session and every 2-3hours
or so after that.

The liquid nitrogen cools a cold trap which condenses out crap in your
microscope column, keeping your vacuum crisp.

COVER THE MICROSCOPE VIEW SCREEN with that plastic cover. Liquid
Nitrogen may break it if it touches it. Thermal shock and all that.
Remove the cap from the cold trap by the string. Put the funnel setting
on the keypad in. Pour nitrogen until its overflowing. Put cap back on.

### Using Heater to boil off

last user of the day procedure

Putting sample holder in
------------------------

1.  Put your sample in the holder. I'm having trouble getting carbon
    side down to get in focus (down becomes up in microscope, on the
    other hand, everything is transmitted thorugh the entire sample).
    Trying carbon side up. tough call. carbon sideu p seemed nice in
    double tilt, the more natrual carbon side down in single tilt

2.  Put holder in holder hole. Push in until stops. Wait until light
    turns green and pressure sensor goes below 35 in the sepcimen
    chamber

3.  Turn clockwise, let in. Turn clockwise more. The vacuum will pull
    the sample in. Be ready for the by pulling outward. gently let the
    sample be pulled into the scope

4.  Change the setting in JEOL menus to correct sample holder.

BEAM
----

1.  Push the beam button

2.  press low mag (Right control panel). you'll often be on something
    opaque so you can't see any beam. Scroll around with trackball (or
    arrows next to trackball) until you can find some beam.

3.  Cool.

Bright Tilt
-----------

Gun
---

Note sure how much this is really required

1.  press birght tilt on alignment panel

2.  anode wobbler

3.  use tilt kobs to make beam expand and ocntract concenetrically

Condensor aperture
------------------

1.  Birghtness knob. Converge Beam

2.  center with shift x shift y knobs

3.  overfocus, adjust aperture knobs to cetner

4.  back to converged beam. shift x shift y

5.  and so on

Condesnor Stigmation
--------------------

1.  Press cond stig. Mag \> 100k. Converge beam. Adjust def stig knobs
    to make beam round, or traingular

The traingular image may be an image of your beam source. The microscope
is set up to take anything in the specimen plane and trasnfer it
magnified to the screen. The converged beam is due to placing an image
of the source in the specimen plane.

Other theory: Triangular due to 3rd order abberation?

HT Wobble
---------

1.  find feature on sample x100k

2.  get good z hight

3.  wobbler ht

4.  select bright tilt

5.  adjust beam deflectors to minmize motion

Setting Stage Height
--------------------

1.  Converge beam with Brightness Knob (Left Panel) at Magnification ?

2.  You'll see some diffraction rings. press Z up or down to remove the
    rings

3.  Alternative: Press ImageX to make image wiggle. Press z up or down
    to minimize wiggling. Press imagex again to make it stop. Do the
    same with ImageY.

Objective Focus
---------------

1.  Go to digital Micrograph on the second mon itor. Select the orion
    camera on the far right. click start camera.

2.  Find AMorphus area. Camera image is \~ 15x bigger than one on screen

3.  Get a box tool in the upper toolbar. press shift to keep it square
    select a nice juicy areas. Go to processes -\> Live reduced FFT. Try
    to make the rings as large as possible with focus. Try to round them
    with objective stig. Magniifiation 150-200k

4.  ALternative: slightly underfocus? to see fresnel fringes. obj stig
    button. Adjust xy def until contrast is sharp. adjust focus closer
    to optical foucs and repat . objective lens astigmatism .s optimized
    when very little contrast at edge? What? That is a contradiction.

Objective stigmation 
--------------------

Find a hole. under or overfocus. you'll see streaking, or fresnel
fringes will not be omnidriectional. adjust objective stigmator to
remove streaks or make frginesuniform., now underfocus/ overfcous. Do
agin. and again. Until just blurs and fringes omnidrectionally. Do at
pregressively higher resolutions.

Objective aperture
------------------

Getting that sample holder out
------------------------------

1.  Beam off (turn lights off, look for green in the window. If there is
    some, press the Beam button under the little clear plastic cover on
    the left control panel). apertures out (All are turned so that the
    red dot aligns with the black dot).

2.  Undo the snaps on the holder casing. Gently pull the holder out.
    Turn counter clockwise until stops. pull a little. turn more
    counterclockwise. do not pull. flip switch to air. wait 30 seconds.
    You'll hear a couple noises. Then you're free to pull the holder out

3.  If you're done for the day, set microscope to Mag2 (x40k) (button on
    the right control panel). This keeps the coils toasty for the next
    user (if they cool down, they'll drift until they warm back up).
