SPlit into two parts

$f(x)=(1-e^{-x^{2}})f(x)+e^{-x^{2}}f(x)$

$f(r)=(1-e^{-\kappa r})f(r)+e^{-\kappa r}f(r)$

FOruier transform nonlocal part

$f(x)=e^{-x^{2}}f(x)+\int e^{ikx}f(k)$

This is similar to setting a cutoff between high freqeunc stuf and low
frequncy stuff. Same idea, different analytical form. Perhaps easier to
pull off

One is sharp behavior (shielded potential), other is long range
behavior. This is somehow connected to RPA (introduction of plasmons)

Decompose wavefunction like this?

$\psi=$

Decopmpose quantum field like this?

decompose density matrix like so - long range and short range
correlations.

$\nabla\psi=k\psi$ on boundary. Boundary eigenvalues and bulk
eigenvalues. Matrix pencils. We oculd have a different vairable for
every position, but it is convenient to collect them up. Projective
momentum. $\alpha\nabla\psi-\beta\psi=0$.Maybe a good idea maybe not.
Dirichlet Neumann map.

$A-kBC$

Degenrate eigenspectrum would want extra pamarters in secular equation.
