Really good 2D systems of high purtiy can now be made. The Quantum
Hall effect blew minds.

The hall resistance is quanitzed, while the magnetoresistance vanishes
(magnetoresistance is where the regular resistance changes in repsonse
to applied field.)

electrons 

Statistics change from boson to vfemrion and back.

The electrons absorb flux quanta?

Epitaxail growth of semiconductors with different band gaps make thin
potnetial wells. GaAs/AlGaAs 2d carriers have mean free path $\lambda$
of 0.1mm. HUGE

Magnetic fields cause splitting in ladnau levels. Energy now comes
in quanta of cyclotron freqeuncy. Spin degerenacy is lifted. degenracy
is $eB/h$ states per area.

Cyclotron $\omega=qB/m$. 

$\nu=n/d$ The filling factor is actual denisty divided by landau
level state density.

$h/e=\phi$ the flux quantum. $\nu$ is electron to flux density (Duality
between vortices and particles? Circuit duality? Circuit duality with
respect to zome reference impedance. Riemann Sphere. Inversion. Poles
to zeros). Electrons per flux quantum.

$h/e^{2}$ is the resistance quantum

Experimental condition. Measure Current. Measure voltage orthogonal
and along. Divide to get maghnetirestance and hall reisstance

Classical hall resistance is $R=B/ne$. Conveneient for measuring
n the denisty of conducting electrons.. The quantum hall effect has
plateaus that follow around this line. So it does increase roughly
linearly.

At vanishing magentoresistance, the system is insulating.

The width of a landau band is visible in the diagram?

FQHE the filling factor is an exact fraction.

Coulomb force drives correlation between electros,

Presence of magnetic field reuqires wavefunction to have as many zeros
and flux quantum penetrate per unit area. What is a zero in a many
body wavefunction? Fixing all variables except one?

Magnetic Legnth $l=\sqrt{\hbar/eB}.$Each zero of FGHE state ``heals''
on this legnth scale?

Vortices are charge deficits. That's bad? So they attract electrons.
Wait. What? Th vortex is a zero of the electron wavefunction. How
can it attract electrons? The other electrons?

Is the inotrudctin of magnetic field moving the electrons such that
they cancel the incoming flux?

Vortex generating flux quanta

Composite Fermions. Some shaky way you combine vortices and electrons
and then you couple those to more vortices?

\subsection{Conductance viewed as transmision}

Traidstional view is response to applied electric field. Different
view is codnuction as due to injection of electrons at one end.

Semiclasscial thinking dominates traditional thoery. Use qwuantum
band structure and quantum sctatering cross sections, but then use
classical movement otherwise using distributions in these propgating
states. Boltzmann like

Kubo gave first totally quantum verison. Extended thoery of polaization.

Circuit thoery does not give votlage as cause and current as effect.
New apporach is current casues self consitsent buildup of charge,
hence electric field

Field in tunnelling barrier is localized around barrier. Not mean
free path inside contacts. 

\subsection{Nakahara Homotopy}

Homotopy is the study of maps from well understood spaces to complicated
ones. S1 is the circle, which maps to loops in the space. Continuous
defomrations between images

Arcwise connectedness: If there exist a path between any two points

Means fundamental group is indepdnant of basepoint

Conjugation by the connection path

Topologically distnct states of fields -

COnsider the following geometry. You have a function defined in space
S(x). You can divide the space into distinct classes by specifying
surfaces S<a. This is the analog of topologically inequivlaent field
configurations $F[\phi]<k_{B}T$, divides the function space into
diffrent classes. For actions, you can only borrow something something
hbar of action. Of you can only borrow such and such energy for a
time that is under the heisneberg uncertainty. Or momentum for a space
less than hbar.

The mixing of the topology of the domain (Balls of various dimensionality
- loops spheres etc) going into 

Two field configurations are physically (homeomorhpic, homotopic)
if they can be deformed into one another while never passing through
a state of energy greater than kT.

The functional integral (volume integral) may be subdivided into an
integral of loops ( sum of tubes) or an integral of spheres ( sum
of shells).

Berry phase is kind of like an order parameter. The degeneracy points
are the vortex cores of paramatezied hamiltonians

Model mh,mailtonains as order parameters

r dimensionals contours external to a core a of d' dimension + 1 radial
direction = d of space.

On the contour (Whihc is $S_{r}$) we map to the order parater (Which
is often $S_{d'}$ for n vector models, but could be a projective
space for nematic crystals or whatevs). Therefore, each core gets
a member of the homotopy group assigned to it.

Magnetic field. Vecotr potential due to magnetic field. Some sort
of potential for A? In gauge \textbf{$\nabla\cdot A=0$}, then A =
$\nabla\times C$. Hence C= coulomb of B, A = biot savart of B, just
like sliding down one using A,B,J.

If we have two wires move around each other, the ensuing loop integral
of B is analogous to phase 

Phase dynamics

$\nabla\times A+\dot{F}=B$

$\nabla\times F+\dot{A}=E$
