Deriving the hydrodynamic model from first principal is an onerous task.
It would be difficult.

The really cute thing is that the interaction turns into a quadratic
term instead of a quartic. In a sense this is trivial. The interaciton
is quadratic in the density since it is a solution to the lapce
equation, that is where the 1/r potential comes from. On the other hand,
it is a bizarre cheat. Even with a linearized dispersion, can one
determine the particle distribution from just the density? How important
is quantum mechanics and the funny relation between position and
momentum.

How does one describe density modes in terms of the microscopic degrees
of freedom. In the sound going through air, it would be statistical. In
the sound through a crystal. Clearly we lose a great deal of detail.

In 1-D alone we do not lose so much detail is the story.

What is the Green's function for a 1-D free model.

What is a green's function? It is the amplitude corresponding to
insertion of a particle at one time and place and removing it at
another. Such an insertion could be achieved via tunnelling for example.
Placing a tunelling tip at x and another at x'.

$G(x,x',t,t')=<\psi(x,t)\psi^{\dagger}(x,t)>$

$G(k,k',t,t')=<\psi(k',t')\psi^{\dagger}(k,t)>=\delta_{kk'}\theta(k-k_{f})\theta(k+k_{f})e^{i\frac{k^{2}}{2m}(t-t')}$

What goes up must come down. In 1-D the energy band diagram is periodic
in k. This means that it must cross the fermi level an even number of
times.
