Where am I at.
--------------

My calculation has progressed to the point of calculating the integer
quantum hall effect current. I have some mechanical understanding of
bosonization. The $ia$ confuses me still. From whence does this come?
Can bosonization be made explicit?

Some old considerations: Discrete models: The point split density looks
just like a hopping term. To make point split gauge invariant, need to
include vector potential exponential.

The chern simons theory. Duality in 2D and the magnetization and
polarization.

Non-abelian Chern Simons? Do not understand.

What should i actually be calculating?

Disttracions: Superconductivty. Anyons. Topological matter. All
techincally not pertinent.
