The boigulobv particles -connection to BCS wavefunction?

Bogiubov and the poorly expanded harmonic oscillator

Bogiubov and the weak parametric oscillator.

The gap function - the freqeuncy of a charge oscillation depends on the
denisty of the superlfuid I believe. A moving wuasiparticle is a
slighlty different game, a moving particle inserted into a
supercodncutor

The gap function is a combo of the effective attractive potential
$g\delta$pulling it back and the pair wavefunction. This might be the
same thing

The superfluid - bogiubov particles lead to source terms. similar to my
idea of self consistent effective sources being equivalent to born
series.

The fermi satistics

My conception of Whats going on:

Bogoliubov particles as quantization of basic inserted charge
oscillation

behavior of electron in classical superconductor background

off diagonal long range order - how should we combine seperate
superconductors?

Pairing as variational wavefunction

Why can we go unfixed particle? 1. its not a big deal - the effective
srouce. 2. The pair insertion operator as a transfer from condensate to
electron half of our system 3. going back from unfixed to fixed - grand
canonical ensemble

The difference between hydrogen gas and cooper gas

How important are fermi statistics? No guarantee of bound states in 3d.
