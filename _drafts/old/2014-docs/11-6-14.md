Laughin quasipartilces are putting in one extra flux quantum

Luaghlin state is more diffuse than equivalent inbteger state. Z\^3.
push outward.

Filling factor is flux qunata per electron. or $\frac{B}{\phi_{0}n}$.
The flux qauntum is 4\*10\^-15 Wb and $\frac{hc}{e}$ . $px=\hbar$.
$p=e\frac{A}{c}$. $Ax=\phi$

What does second landau level wavefunctions look like?

plasma analogy to find filling factor. Average density is such that the
plasma neatrualizes. Hence
