Resonance model. Coupled oscillator that reradiates

Plasmon model. Density of electrons in uniform background. Polarization
leads the E vector which tugs back on fluid

Scaling solution of exact laplacian by schur complement removal of
highest eigenmode then interpolation.

Schur complement and spectra?

Where do you put statistical averages?

Coherence and the random source model. Green's functions and radnom
sources

Improvements to $i0$ technique.

representation thoery of graph symmettries. Wassup?

Representation Theory and crystal symmettries and fourier transform
scattering

compton scattering - incoherent?

momentum transfer

Debye Waller

Dislocations. Consider the crystal frame as a function of position. Sort
of differential goemetry/ GR-y. Topology obviously too. The metric has
fluctuations that are a function of desnity of dislocations. The
transport propertirs aof a loop are statistical. The larger the loop,
the larger the standard deviation of possible loop closure

Legendre transfoormation of reflection surface with change in memontum
stuck into it is the T angle charectersitc?

Imagine scattering off of a long thin strong gaussian (Gaussian plane).
Bron approximation says that fourier transform of guassian should be
scattering amplitude. slogn sides become short and short long, thus the
fourier transform looks like the normal line to the plane, except there
is a cutoff at 1/wall thickness. Short enough wavelengths don't see wall
anymore, transparecy lmit.
