Majorana Notes
==============

Kitaev Chain is basically SSH chain.

A majorana is a bound state of a vortex and a bogoliubov particle. I do
ot think I can spearate the two. Kitaev chain shows that majorana also
exists on domain wall? Domain wall could be considered many many stacked
vortices.

Pfaffian holes. The fact that when two positions are the same, they can
be come trivial or not is very important

SU(2n) is group of 2n particles. representation can be built using
jordan wigner chain to build creation and annihilation, then taking real
and imaginary part taking $\sigma_{\pm}$ to $\sigma_{x/y}$

Pfaffian State

Vortex creation: take linear cuts then you can see whats happening.
passing through the vortices the tansition looks like a parabola being
lowered through zero creating 2 zeros. passing right between them

Nayak and Wilczek is king.

All permutations of holes into the 2 groups gives $\frac{(2n)!}{n!n!2}$.
But an indepdnant basis is one where you pick canconical pairs that
never go into the same group. $2^{n-1}$. a factor of 2 for every choice
of which member of the pair to pick.

The conformal block basis is one that makes chern simons integrals
noexsitant in some sense.

COnfromals Field thoery - Operator state corrsepondance. I can do
everything at one point.

The pfaffian hole state is trivial if all holes at same position.
Perhaps make dipole vortices. Infinitesimally separated vortices

Overcomplete berry phase. COnsider the nonlocal metric $g(x,x')$
(essentially this is $<x|x'>$ the vairous combinations of basis a those
points. measures overlap of the overcomplete hole position basis)

Are all paired states expressible as a pfaffian? Kind of seems like it.
Pfaffian is for superocundctors what deterimant is for ordinary metals.
