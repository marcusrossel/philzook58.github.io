Clifford Algebra
================

The rudiment of all Geometric trnasformations is Reflection
-----------------------------------------------------------

Reflection.

Reflection.

Reflection.

Do you get the idea yet?

Reflection.

Alright, now that you have been compelled by the rightness of my stance,
let's examine why it is true.

Stereographic Projection
========================

Cameras and Homogenous Coordinates
----------------------------------

Spin 1/2
--------

Riemann Sphere. Is connected by extra single point because

Special Relativities effect on Spheres
--------------------------------------

Mainly I was thinking about celestail sphere and scattering in new
reference frames

Abberration of light

Lorentz theory of the electron?

Spheres are connected to ellipsoids via lorentz boost, hence the conic
section viewpoint might be a good idea

Scattering 
----------

Rutherford, hard sphere, general

Pseudorapidity
--------------

Mandelstahm Variables
---------------------

I have my suspicions. Crossing symmettry and cross ratio. Looks very
much like barycentric coordinates

Scattering Geometry
===================

The Asymptotic Sphere
---------------------

Under galilean transfromations (different observer speeds in ordinary
classcial mechanics), Different observers see ball shoot off towards
different angular directions.

$$x=x_{0}-v_{x}t$$

$$\vec{r}=\vec{r}_{0}+\vec{v}t$$

As $t\rightarrow\infty$, basically the particle has gone in whatever
direction (in terms of angles) that the velocity pointed.

Switching observers is just adding a constant velocity vector $V$ to all
velocities, but this changescompletely the asymptotic angular direction
of scattering, as you commonly see in the shift from CM coordinates to
lab coordinates. Geometrically, this shift is a translation in the
hodograph (velocity) space. The asymptotic angular space is treating
hodograph space as a projective space. The radial distance (total
velocity) does not matter, but the ratios do. When we do the addition
however, that is naughty projectively speaking, since the result depends
inohomogoenously on the input vectors. I suggest we should close
hodograph space as a projective space $RP^{3}$ itself.

Weyl and Dirac Equations
========================

Pilot spinors

d'Alembert solution

kirchoff factor?

Needing gamma 0 to make scalars feels so odd
