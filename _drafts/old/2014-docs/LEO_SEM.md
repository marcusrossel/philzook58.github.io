Tan computer has progra that runs microscope

next for ebeam

anotehr for eds

and another for tensle test holder

typically EM server program running

expand to full screen

ctrl-d puts data bar up

Tools \> control panel \> SEM control

if you push button on ontrol panel and does nothing it needds to be
reset. Rset is bush button on back using a pen

put carbon tape on aluminum mount

put aluminum mount in stage

set screw snug

All vent buttons do the same thing. under vacuum, gun vacuum,

Nitrogen, turn on tank do not touch regulator

should tak less than 5 minutes

slide on

push pump button

stage \> stage inititalize puts stage under beam

Pressure - 10\^-5 torr range in

secondary electrons

cannot do eds with sem. too much substrate not enough partidle

10kev is good place to start . microscope goes from 100v to 30kv eht
target

20kev or lesx since it turns electrostatc lens off at 21kv

backscatter detector

don"t run sample into lens. 8kv difference

under gun\>

beam state eht on

variable pressure SEM. can put nitrogen in for insulating smaples. might
work.

we have a shitty cold stage

icon just to the left of two yellow bulbs

detector \> Inlens detector

LB stands for left button

MB stands for middle button

WD working distance = focus

ctrl + tab to cetner image

change sliders until doesn;t move much

yellow lozenge button is aistgmation

ctrl shift s \> auto focus auto stigmate

sometimes it sucks - cnacel

scanning

scan speed 10 or 11 = 40 seconds

freeze on end frame

click freeze

scan seed 5 or 6 is good for vieiwing.

plasma cleaner?

Bad solvents carbonize like crap
