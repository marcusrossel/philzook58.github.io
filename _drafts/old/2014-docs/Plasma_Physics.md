The regimes: Is there current inertia (will currents that get started
keep going. Two forms: mass inertia due to the mass of the charged
particles and inductive inertia due to iductors liking to keep current
flowing)? Is there heavy damping (Like honey, ohm's law).

How hot are plasmas? Thermal effects.

Child Langmuirs

Richardson's Law

Cold Plasmas - Two fluid formalism. The variation of voelcity is not
relevant compared to the mean velocity. Plasmafluids. we use a velcotuy
field.

For small wave ampltiudes, we can use Polarization. This implies that
particles had some sort of original location

Kinetic Theory + EM = hot plasmas

debye layer - electrons make electron deficits around themselves. What
do we mean by this? Well, the electrons anti bunch. Its a correlation
effect. Given an electron is here another one won't be nearby. Inside
the debye layer we have unshieled field, outside we have damped field.
Damping depdns on temprutre and charge and denisty. Use some dime
nsional analysis $kT=ne^{2}\lambda$. The self consitent field method.

Langmuir Sheathes

Plasma frequency. Considera single electron in a unifrom oscillating
field. Resonance occurs when $\omega_{p}$

Magnetohydrodynamics

Landau Damping - COnsider the same situuation as plasma freqeuncy except
now consider the wavelength factor.

Particle Motion - Acceleration, Cyclotron motion. Drift. Mirror Points.
Adiabatic Invariants. $\mu=\frac{v_{\perp}^{2}}{2B}$ The dipole moment
stays the same. Movement into higher fileds causes a lenzs law type
dealy. Let's pretend that the electron is actually a rotating hoop
(average through a cycltron period). If this is true then the
perpendicular velocity must be raised. Therefore the parrallel velicty
to the B field must lower, unitl it has to flip.
