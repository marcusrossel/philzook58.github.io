Why $\lambda$= Probing Length
-----------------------------

In 2d you can see 2-d circle of foureir transform. From all possible
angles, this gives bandlimitting. Scaling Smapling theorem? Assume the
signal is a scaling signal. How much smapling do we need to reconstruct?
Equivlanet of dirac comb? Connection to renormalization procsdue.
$e^{r\frac{d}{dr}}$ is scaling operator. In what basis is this diagonal
(wavelet? Bessel?)? $e^{a\frac{d}{dx}}$ is translation
$\sum e^{na\frac{d}{dx}}$is dirac comb. Use to reconstruct from band.
$\sum\frac{1}{nr}e^{nr\frac{d}{dr}}$ use to reconstruct from band.
Bessel series in circle. What does it extend to outside circle?

are Bessel functions the natural fgunctions correposnding to radial
scaling the way fourier are to translations and spherical to rotations
and sine to fnite translation? Homogenous polynomials are linear scaling
functions.
