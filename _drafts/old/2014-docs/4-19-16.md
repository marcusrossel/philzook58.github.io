We can define a 1-d quantum field thoery using anyons very easily. It
looks like the above.

Just the anyon tree compressed to a line

The the hamiltonian might be

H=\| \>\< \|

1: it can have terms that energetically favor obeying the anyon
relations. Or we can take this as a constraint. Same sides of a coin

2: braiding terms can make particles move left and right.
