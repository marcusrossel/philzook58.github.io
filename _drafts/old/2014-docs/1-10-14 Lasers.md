Temporal Coherence

Beam divergence

dxdp\>hbar

becomes Ldk\>1

$Lkd\cos\theta>1$

Well really we want

$Lkd\sin\theta>1$ if we use the angle to the optical axis

and for small angles

$\theta>\frac{\lambda}{L}$ ish

Incoherent wave L = coherence length. not aperture. Does that make
sense?

asers can be used to tradeoof monochormaticty for short pulse time

$\rho(\omega)=A(\omega)f_{B}(\omega)$

Denisty of states times bose eistein distriubtion
$f=\frac{1}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}$ gives occupation density of modes
\<n\> number of phtons in mode.

$k=\frac{\omega}{c}$

Denisty of states for photons is
$\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\pi)^{3}}=\frac{4\pi\omega^{2}d\omega}{c^{3}(2\pi)^{3}}$
times 2 for polarizations
$A(\omega)=\frac{8\pi\omega^{2}}{c^{3}(2\pi)^{3}}$

Energy denisty of modes

$E(\omega)=\hbar\omega A(\omega)f_{B}(\omega)$

which gives all in all

$E=\frac{\hbar\omega^{3}}{c^{3}\pi^{2}}\frac{1}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega}-1}$

Well, that's closeish. My constants are wrong for some reason

Real space thermal correlations of electric field. $\nabla\cdot E=0$
introduces tons of spatial correlations

$$<E(x,t)E(x',t')>=G$$

$\nabla\cdot G=0$

$\nabla\cdot G^{T}=0$

For my semiclassical question, I really only need same position
correlation.

Classical Fermi phase space. Cut a hole of volume hbar out of possible
places to put next fermion. An interesting game of tetris. What if you
cut swiss cheese holes and then had a state that was the cheese?

Line broadening
---------------

use signal of random phase jumps occurring at random intervals. (poisson
distured time between random phase pertubration)

Then autocrrelation

$$<\int u(t)u(t+\tau)dt>=\int D[u]P[u]\int u(t)u(t+\tau)dt$$

The random adiabtic potential will do this. (Random adiabtic potentials
are one way of introudicing impurities into a material. Is this RPA
somehow?) You turn some interaction on and then off. Then it will reamin
in its state before and after. But it will screw with its phase in a
manner that depedns on the details of the interaction and the lenght of
time. Berry phase?
