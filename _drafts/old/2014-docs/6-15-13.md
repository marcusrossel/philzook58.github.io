Band Theory
-----------

$$V=I\otimes V_{cry}$$

$$T=C$$

C is the circulant 2nd derivative matrix thanks to Born boundary
conditions

$$H=T+V$$

The first is the lattice space and the second space is the sublattice
space. The question is how to split up the Kinetic Energy operator into
a Kronecker form. We do a partial fourier transform on only the lattice
space

$$(F\otimes I)^{\dagger}C(F\otimes I)=C'=k\otimes K?$$

$$T=I\otimes K+W$$

Perturbing macroscopic potentials, like applied field gradients will
effectively be constant over the lattice, so we can write them as

$$V_{ext}=V_{ext}\otimes I$$

If I use chebyshev basis to fit noisy data, do i still need
regularization?
