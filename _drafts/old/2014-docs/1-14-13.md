The source method. Implied is the location of the source/ It is a
parameter. the finite matrix is the value of the source

$$j(x)=\sum j_{i}\delta(x-x_{i})$$

The the Green's function is a vector

$$g^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
G(x,x_{1}) & G(x,x_{2}) & G(x,x_{3})\end{array}\right]$$

$$g^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\int dx'\phi_{1}(x')G(x,x') & G(x,x_{2}) & G(x,x_{3})\end{array}\right]$$

maybe $\phi=\delta$ or maybe something lumpier

$$\phi(x)=g^{T}j$$

$$\left[\begin{array}{c}
j_{1}\\
j_{2}\\
j_{3}\\
\\
\end{array}\right]$$

It seems impossible that the entire space of states is acceisble via
forcing of classical sources

Anyhow the quantum fields are identifiable subkrons of the entire state

$|\psi(x)>\otimes|A(x)>$

X-----\>----X feynman represents source to source

Source cutoff and Detector cutoff, amplification being the system in
between. (Detector being your eye or something. Or approximately
macroscopic \~1m scale, source being \~1nm or whatever). Source cutoff,
intesnity, detector cutoff, sensitivity. Coherency.

Averaging over random phase brings in charecterstic function

$<e^{i\phi}>$$<e^{iks}$\>is the definintion of the charecterstic
function of a probaility distribution (the exponent of the cumulant
generating function) It is the ofurier transform of the distriubtion of
phase or distrubtion of path length.. First order born approximation to
