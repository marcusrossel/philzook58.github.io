Phase locked loop is ideally a amplitude clamping filter on the analytic
sigmal, leaving phase alone. Just an ordinary ampltiude clamp does not
achieve this, generates harmonics out the butt.

WKB method in time dependant filtering? =\> phase dyniamcs, phase
feedback

The ananlog of the born integral in parametric amplification thoery?
