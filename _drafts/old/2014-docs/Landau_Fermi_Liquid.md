Landau Fermi Liquid

The landau approach is to abstract away all the detailed assumptions
made in thoeries and see what is left. It is meta-theory.

The Fermi Liquid thoery is the abstraction of other thoeries of the
electron gas

First off, it is better the have the paradigm of He3 in your head rather
than the familiar electrons in a metal.

The ideal fermi gas has a fermi surface. That's messed up
