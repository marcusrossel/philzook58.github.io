Dirichlet to neumann map - can be used to convert boundary conditions.

In what sense is a cutout strip schur a dirichlet to neumann map? The
vector is indeed the boundary values, but the right hand side is
derivative (normal derivative?)? double sipole layer

Conversion from the S-matrix to the Left to right matrix is different
boundary conditions from my inverse paper

Is it possible

Sommerfeld cutout tiny domain green's function to add point values as
boundary conditions, or cutout a layer.

Condition number and boundary conditions

Inutuition on pi/T netowrk?
