Majorana are 1/2 of a driac fermion. They are their own complex
conjuagte. Considering the dirac fermion to be a field, on way to get
them is they are the complex or the real part of that field.
$\psi+\psi^{\dagger}$ or $\psi+i\psi^{\dagger}$. Bogoloibons in
supercoductivty are similar although not necessarily

The p+ip superconductor.

$H=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
(p^{2}+V-\nu) & \{\Delta,\partial_{x}+i\partial_{y}\}\\
\{\Delta^{*},\partial_{x}-i\partial_{y}\} & -(p^{2}+V-\nu)
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
c\\
c^{\dagger}
\end{array}\right]$

This is how you deal with a constant phase put into the supercondcting
gap

$H=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
V & \Delta e^{i\theta}\\
\Delta e^{-i\theta} & -V
\end{array}\right]$

$E=\pm\sqrt{V^{2}+\Delta^{2}}$

$H\rightarrow U^{\dagger}HU$

$\left[\begin{array}{c}
u\\
v
\end{array}\right]\rightarrow U\left[\begin{array}{c}
u\\
v
\end{array}\right]$

$U=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{i\frac{\theta}{2}} & 0\\
0 & e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}}
\end{array}\right]=e^{\frac{i\sigma_{z}}{2}\theta}$

Sending the order parameter through $2\pi$ sends the eigenfucntion
through -1. This is mathematically identical to the spinor -1 that
occurs from rotating about the z axis by $2\pi$.

The minus sign is down below because of fermi statistics.

You can lose the $p^{2}$ term to calulate the bound state. This is very
evocative to me of losing the $p^{2}$term to calculate in the LLL.

You can explicitly also let $\Delta(x)$. this is reminiscent of landau
gauge.

I've been conceiving of the p+ip term as sort of a vector potential kind
of term. It is symmetrical sandwiched on a derivative just like $Ap+pA$.
Some kind of self consistent magnetic field? A vector potential in the
$\left[\begin{array}{c}
u\\
v
\end{array}\right]$ space? adibatic transport. If true would make
connection to nanabeian gauge theory more apparent. The vector potential
is a matrix acting in the uv space. This corresponds to adiabatic
transport of bogliubov quasiparticles. A-B phase of intefering bogiubon
around a vortex.

My hypotheisis about usperocudctors include that they are somehow
related to parametric oscillators, and that considering an electron in
the pressence of the classical superfluid makes sense. Hence a bulk
electron has overshoot and oscilaltes between particle and hole. What
changes for the p+ip? Are the macroscopic laws different?

One suggests very loosely that somehow we combine quantum hall and
supercoductivty behavior. $j=\sigma E$ and $\dot{j}=\frac{e}{m}E$

The pfaffian form of the FQHE state takes the realspace form of a BCS
wavefunction.

$\psi=Pf(\frac{1}{z_{1}-z_{2}})e^{-\frac{1}{4}|z|^{2}}$

From Fradkin et al. two quaisiparticles at $Z_{1,2}$.

$\psi=Pf(\frac{(z_{i}-Z_{1})(z_{j}-Z_{2})+i\leftrightarrow j}{z_{i}-z_{j}})\prod(z_{i}-z_{j})^{2}e^{-\frac{1}{4}|z|^{2}}$

It is not clear to me that

### London Equations

Conceptually there seems to be a couple programs at play.

Bind electrons to vortices

Vortices are funny little fellas in supercoductors

There is the charged sloshing mode like in the integer hall, but then
there is also the majorana mode that seperates off? It's not that
obvious that the majorana mode is that special. At the position where
the majorana forms it is still part of the continuous spectrum.

Do we achieve this macroscopically by adding a hall term to the london
equations? An inserted electron, instead of just pulsating radially,
also winds itself due to bound flux.
