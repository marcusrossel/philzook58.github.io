The pfaffian. What is its deal.

Its for antisymmetric matrices

Antisymmetric real matrics \* i are hermitian, so it has an complex
eigenvalues

Also any eigenavlue also has a negative counterpart. Av=$\lambda v$.
$A^{T}u=\lambda u=-Au$

odd sized antisymmtric matrices must have 1 0 eigenvalue because they
have to pair.

Well, its square is the determinant of a matrix

It shows up in dimer models.

a directed graph labels the link with a direction. It tells you how to
take derivatives on the graph.

The first derivative matrix can have funny structure. This is one way to
discretize the dirac equation.

if you can come up with a drectional labelling such that every term in
the pfaffian has the same sign, the pfaffian is counting all the ways to
dimerize the lattice.

The determinant can be easily calculated using the eigenvalues.
Labelling a square lattice this way can use alternating directions. Or
it can label the link with i via a gauge trasnfromation.

The inverse of this matrix somehow has the correlation functions of
dimers built into it. Dimers are fermions somehow?

The hieght graph might have something to do with bosonization. There is
suspicious character

Discrete complex plane
