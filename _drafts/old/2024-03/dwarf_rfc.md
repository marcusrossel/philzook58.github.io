DIE_ASSERT
A useful capability that t has not been clear is currently expressible in the dwarf standard is to represent user written or compiler generated assertions in dwarf. This enables debuggers to automatically detect issues even when the asserts have not been compiled in to the code. t offers a new modality for sanitizers. It also represent a target for work on binary static analyzers and verifiers (see CBAT paper, whatevr else I can dig up).
