title: The Boltzmann Constant kb is the inverse of Avogadro's number Na
---

No, I'm not insane.

kb ~ 1/N

On the face of this it is nonsense. The units don't work. Boltzmann's constant is unitful. Its value depends on your system of measure. Avogadro's constant converts between moles and a count. A mole is kind of like a dozen. It's almost more like changing the base of your number system than it is like changing units.

But the point stands. The remarkable exponent of kb is -23 and the exponent of N is 23.
Why?

This is not exactly a coincidence. It is because we are human beings and defined our units of measure in terms of human quantities.

The kg is approximately the units sausage are sold in. Meters are about how big horses are. We can feel fluctuations of temperature in the ballpark of 1 degree.

Long before we were sure about atoms and exactly how big they might be, we were measuring temperatures and volumes and such.
An inarguable fact is that kN = R, where R is the gas constant. R is 8.314. At the level of coarseness we are talking R is effectively 1 in human scale units. N is approximately the number of atoms in human scale stuff. Kb is

So this fact that these constants are inverse is really a relative of the anthropic principle.

pV = nRT

Maybe another way of putting it is there is 1humanlength = 1meter  like how 1 lightmeter = c

A wonderful coincidence or an expected connection: why π² ≈ g.
