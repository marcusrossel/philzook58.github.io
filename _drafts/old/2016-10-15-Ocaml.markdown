The ocaml repl is annoying. No previous command? That's ridiculous.

Installing utop as alternative

opam install utop

    
    <code class="ocamltop"><span class="ocaml-input"><span class="governing">let</span> <span class="ocaml-function">average</span> <span class="ocaml-variable">a b </span>=
        (a +. b) /. 2.0</span><span class="ocaml-prompt">;;</span></code>


You have to defne top level stuff with let

The dots are for float ops.
