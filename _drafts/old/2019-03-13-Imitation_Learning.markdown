My bro Mark pointed out his seminar materials. I have not played around with imitation learning enough. It feels like lower hanging fruit than reinforcement learning, with some very satisfying results. He claimed he got a self driving robot car from VIDEO after 15 minutes of training data and 2 minutes of tensorflow optimization time. THAT IS NUTS!







He uses a small convolutional neural network, heavily basing it on the NVIDIA PilotNet work. https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/







Are my robot car notes up?







I should try training pong
