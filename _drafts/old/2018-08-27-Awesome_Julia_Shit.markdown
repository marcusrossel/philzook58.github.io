I have been digging through the Julia community



It actually isn't the most high profile projects that intrigue me the most.

The highest star count stuff is basically replicated functionality you'll find elsewhere.

Plots, Matrices, ODE solvers, DataFrames, neural net shit, automatic differentiation,



But it is really the JuMP community that gets me going

Julia Robotics



Polyhedra.jl: What is this even FOR. OH YEAH
