pybullet is an interesting 3d pysics simulator that a lot of robot and reinfrcement learning guys are using

It has bindings in python.

The docs

https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#

sudo pip3 install pybullet

There is also a github. There is an examples folder

    
    import pybullet as p
    import pybullet_data
    physicsClient = p.connect(p.GUI)#or p.DIRECT for non-graphical version
    p.setAdditionalSearchPath(pybullet_data.getDataPath()) #used by loadURDF
    p.setGravity(0,0,-10)
    planeId = p.loadURDF("plane.urdf")
    cubeStartPos = [0,0,1]
    cubeStartOrientation = p.getQuaternionFromEuler([0,0,0])
    boxId = p.loadURDF("r2d2.urdf",cubeStartPos, cubeStartOrientation)
    p.stepSimulation()
    cubePos, cubeOrn = p.getBasePositionAndOrientation(boxId)
    print(cubePos,cubeOrn)
    p.disconnect()
    


The starting example

There is a bunch of talk about how to run the simulation on a sepearte machine from a client. Perhaps this is for distributed simulation? Or perhaps for bringing the computation off a weaker onboard ocmputer?
