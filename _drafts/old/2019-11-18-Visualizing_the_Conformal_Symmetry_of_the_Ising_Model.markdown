The Ising model is a simple statistical mechanical model. You have a grid of sites with a magnet up or magnet down. They energetically prefer to be aligned, but entropically prefer to be all scrambled up. As you changed the temperature, there can be a phase transition from a disorder to an ordered phase. At the exact temperature of the transition, there is supposed to be a special point of scale invariance.

2D is a very special place. The complex plane is 2d and it just so happens that analytic functions describe conformal maps between two 2d planes. Conformal maps locally preserve angles but not necessarily distances.







Circle packing.
