Interesting.

So If I put a constant field on a thing, and then turn it off, I ought to get a ringing.

Idea: Use frequency generator + lock in as frequency selective guy. Hmm. That is actually very similar to the epr experiment.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge

24 AWG is 84 milliOhms/m

My tube (an oats container) is about 10cm diameter ~ 30cm circumference

I have the patience for 30 wraps = 0.8 ohms * 2 coils = 2 ohms

12V / 2 = 6A

100 wraps -> 2A

200 wraps -> 1A

No way. I'm not disspating 5W in this thing.



Helmholtz coil - distance between coils equals radius
