A canonical problem that frustrates beginner physics students is the elastic collision. Momentum and Energy are conserved.







$latex m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_2 v_{2f} + m_1 v_{1f} $







$latex \frac {1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 +\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 = m_2 v_{2f} + m_1 v_{1f} $







It is an insufficiently well known secret of mathematics (at least it is not a part of a standard physicist's education) that systems of multivariate polynomial equations can be solved completely mechanically in a guaranteed to terminate fashion. The hiccup is that it can take a ridiculously long time. You have to get a little lucky.







Feynman diagrams show a topology of interactions of particles where momentum and energy must be conserved. It is rather remarkable that they have interpretations both classically and quantum mechanically. In classical mechanics, one can write down a system of polynomial equations that describes the conservation of momentum and energy. These same polynomial equations will describe pole structure of quantum mechanical amplitudes.
