Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition

You can basically understand the character of something described by polynomials by looking at it's roots.

Consider logical formula with only 1 variable and polynomials
$$\exists x, x \ge 0 \land x^2 + x = 2 \lor x = 7$$

Collect up all the polynomials.
Collect up all the roots. Collect up all regions between roots.
Just look at all the possible cases.

Hmm. I wonder if this could be boosted by
