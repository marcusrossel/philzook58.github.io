The question I always want answered is WHAT IS THE MAIN ONE, GODDAMNIT.

4046 - PLL chip

AD630 - A lock in chip!

Max260 - programmable filter

Lm565 - a perhaps obsolete PLL chip

Obviously

555

741 - better op amps?

LM386 - power op amp for small speakers

Most digital logic I'm inclined to do in software. Those are most of the

AD620 instrumentaiton amplifier

NE602 mixer

Lt5512 - 1khz - 3Ghz mixer

LT5514 - Wideband programmable gain amplifier

(The whole Lt55xx series is pretty interesting)

AD5791 - 20-bit dac 35Mhz

LTZ10000 - ultra high precision voltage standard

IRF510 - N channel MOSFET. Seen these mentioned a lot for power radio work (lowish frequency ~40Mhz).

Lm567 - A audio frequency ish pll chip. Detect tones
