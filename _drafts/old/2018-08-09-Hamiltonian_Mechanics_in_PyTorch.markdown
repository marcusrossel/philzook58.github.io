Hamiltonian mechanics is a convenient method for generating equations of motion.

p = torch.zeros()

x = torch.zeros()

My friends and I were discussing recently: Why Hamiltonian Mechanics?

Why Legendre Transform?

H=px-L



Using an optimization package to do a numerical Legendre transform. You would need to convert a hessianable function to a new hessianable function.
