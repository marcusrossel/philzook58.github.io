So what have I been up to.

Type theory. How about that. I stopped before in my compiler course after parsing. I skipped over semantic analysis because I was like "Type checking? That's annoying piddly details". I missed out on a lot. That is where a lot of meat is happening. How does a C intepreter know if an expression is type correct? I need to actually do this still (And I need to try out a couple other intepreter/compiler style tasks. I got so hung up on parsing), but I think the computation is sort of a dumbed down evaluation process. The program traverse the abstract syntax tree similarly to how it would to evaluate, and it carries along a type environment similar to how it would carry a scoped environment down with it.

I found a really good disussion
