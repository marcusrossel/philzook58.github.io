Back on the agda train. I guess. Or should I be an idris boy? I want to try idris 2 but it feels not ready. Plus apparently agda has irrelevant notations?

Maybe I should try some of that homotopy stuff I wass trying in Haskell. Kind of defeats the point of "simp0lciity" to be in agda though

New mcbride notes [https://github.com/pigworker/ProgrammerCommaCon/tree/master/CS410-19/Lec](https://github.com/pigworker/ProgrammerCommaCon/tree/master/CS410-19/Lec)

Old mcbride notes document I'd never seen [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.706.8140&rep=rep1&type=pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.706.8140&rep=rep1&type=pdf) Pretty cool

[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=E3CD5927D73589F5E8AC1DE03CB29E05?doi=10.1.1.705.3086&rep=rep1&type=pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=E3CD5927D73589F5E8AC1DE03CB29E05?doi=10.1.1.705.3086&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Dependently typed programming with finite sets

Decidable and Semidecidable. The same as recursive and recrusively enumerable. The same as some part of the arithemtic hierarchy

Observational Types Now says it has some artifact in Agda?

Relationship between theorem proving and partial evaluation. You have to case on stuff because it gets "stuck". Is this the trick? Lambda is the ultaimte abrtaction. I was oncsidering at one point using typeclasses to keep everything abstract that I wanted to stay folded. I guess this is ultimately the finally tagless style, where you use modules or typeclasses to carry around that huge outer lambda. "Charlike" 

Any equality that the compiler can't understand immediately is something that wouldn't partially evaluate to optimized form. If I have some   to . from = id, I want the compiler to know that by construction (basically by beta reduction). It gets blocked on abstract terms.

I did have some impression that Agda might be nice for 2Vect

You know  figuring out if two algerbaic expressions are identical: The easiest thing is to just evaluate them. Maybe define this indictively? Probing for equality.. "Auotmatic" equality. Probe n f.  ; holds n and f such that probing f n unique times is enough to determine equality of g f. n can be overestimate. nf+ ng => nq (I think )

nf * mg => (n + m) h. Why is this?Is this a general ring property or depends on nats?

const x = requires 1

multivariate multiplies probes. (tensoring) Is this inspired by plotkin's talk? Maybe.

Brute force SAT search, or List monad style search

(p : bool -> Set) -> (bool -> Dec (p x)) -> Dec (exists b, pb) - if forall b it's decidable if b satisfies p, it's decidable if b . Where was that website

(bool -> Dec (p x)) -> Dec (forall b, p b)

doit f with f true  f false =   

Maybe I want strong things than Dec p . That's just bools. sometimes I want more. Like, if I had a nat -> ? function, if it could tell me how far I am from the nearest region or truth, that would be nice. Or dual

Duals as proof objects. Give me a set of affine equations( many). If I can produce a vectorial combination of them that gives 0 = 1, then they are inconsistent. Nullstullensatz is analog for polynomial. Fa

Bezout as duals.

An exploration of the standard lib. Stops short unfortunately

http://neil-strickland.staff.shef.ac.uk/formal/agdalib.pdf

I need to stop playing with Nat and just do other stuff

more hotkeys. \bN gives funky N. \Gl gives lambda so does \lambda -> is fine

\all \forall

Linear Functions category

A fun silly category

    
    -- from Conor mcBride's cs410 notes
    
    -- Cmonoid is kind of like the profunctor analog of the Const functor
    newtype CMonoid x a b = CMonoid x
    
    -- with the intent that a and b are ().
    -- using other indices doesn't necessarily hurt though.
    -- could constrain this with a constrained category
    instance Monoid x => Category CMonoid x a b where
       id = CMonoid mempty
       (CMonoid x) . (CMonoid y) = CMonoid (x <> y)

It would be fun to do some number theory style proofs.

record Prime {a : Nat}

(c : Nat -> b : Nat -> c \ne 1 -> b \ne 1 -> b * c == a -> Void) -> Prime a

If you look at the agda standard lib

https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/master/src/Data/Nat/Divisibility.agda

Divisibility seems to be the first notion

m | n

The proof of such statement is to supply a divisor d and the equality proof d * m = n.

Divisiblity forms a partial order. if a divides b and b divides c then a divides c. a divides itself.

These are the first couple theorems.

Prime factorization is quite useful

Can we verify that the maximum of a list is bigger than anything in it? Really, we want that it is the least upper bound.

Case splitting on forall contexts.

a -> a  => case to id

so of weakened function extensionality

{t :: forall a. a -> a} -> t == id

introduce the free theorems as

Laarhoven's simple reflect.

Maybe sometimes have to probe multiple times.

We're very often trying to notice polymorphism at the typeclass level.

newtype NotePolyMorphic -- DO NOT export.

-- safety of incoherence use is guranteed by the unexported NotPolymorphic unification, which will fail unless a was actuall polymorphic

{ Incoherent } (a ~ (NotPolymorphic ,b) => IsUniversal a True

IsUniversal a False
