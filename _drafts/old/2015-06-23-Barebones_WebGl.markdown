I've recently been toying a bit with WebGl, and I thought it might be useful to see what a barest of bones WebGl looks like. There is a lot of boiler plate code that is needed to even get a triangle on the screen. Once you've got that, learning everything else is a joy because you can immediately see the result, but collecting up the minimal implementation is an unpleasant groping in the dark with your uncle.
