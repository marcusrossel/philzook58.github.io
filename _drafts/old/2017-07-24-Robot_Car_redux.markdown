So we got video running over the internet, which gave us a boost.

Here's the plan: use reinforcement learning with the raspi camera to get the robot to move over a fixed location

We took an IR sensor and are getting an IR CCD ring to put as a puck.

I suggest we first get a simulated version of this working.

Go into the WebRTC
