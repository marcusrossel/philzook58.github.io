This is an extremely ambitious suggestion that probably isn't frutiful. I apologize for overextending myself, I do not feel qualified to speak deeply on any of these topics. But to what degree can we connect these disparate things and obtain any sort of understanding via these connections?

They are all on the frontier of difficult but nearly tractable problems. And at a very high level, there are similarities.

Constraints. Frustration. Propagation/Implication. Dimer. Spin Ice. Spin Liquids. Enumeration, ZDDs

Global. Topological. Lattices. Dimension. A notion of space (somewhat unique to physics).

Relaxation. Integer becomes Real, Discrete to Continuous, NonConvex Becomes convex. Approximation by linear, Approximation by quadratic. Free Particles. Steepest Descent. Minimize unsatisfied constraints. LASSO. How solvable is a Abs value problem? Abs value relaxation of qubit/spin system?

Introduction and elimination of variables. Schur Complement. Hubbard-Stratonovich. Decomposition Method. Reduction to binary constraints? Variables representing constraints/ variables representing force fields. The absolute value trick.

Duality - Lagrangian Duality. Effective Lagrangian.

Region Cutting. Branch and Cut. Sum of Steepest Descent / Semiclassical. Summation over topological quantities (winding number)

Factorization. Free Particle. Kronecker Products. CSP. Binary Decision Diagrams. Low Rank. BDDs. Sparsity. Index selection of Low Rank parts.

Many things at once. Superposition. Quantification. Summation. BDDs. Sum of Squares guarantees. Formula manipulation. Algebra. Sequent calculus. Computer Algebra Systems.

Categories. Monoidal Categories. String diagrams. Braiding. Logic. Baez's Stone.

Local Search. Perturbation Theory, Least Discrepancy search. Annealing. Monte Carlo.

Symmetry - Search space reduction. Symettry Breaking. Representation Theory. Commuting variables

Regularization - Prior expectations. Fitting. Sparsity. Too many variables.

Integration - Region of integration = inequality constraints. Delta function = equality, Log concave
