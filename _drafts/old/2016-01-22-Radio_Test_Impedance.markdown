50 ohm load

$latex \omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$

$latex Q=\omega \Delta \omega = \frac{\omega L}{R}$

$latex \Delta \f=1Mhz$

C=6pF

L=10uH

(Parastiics ~100nH, C~1pF)

4.7pF found a peak on coil at 137.37-137.54Mhz of which is upconverted by 125Mhz, 12Mhz resonance

Dip down to -84db from base of -70

A 50Ohm load gives -82db flat
