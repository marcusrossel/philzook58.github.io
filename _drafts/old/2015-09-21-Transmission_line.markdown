When the wavelength of light is comparable to the hunks of metal you're talking about, you need to include the effects of finite time propagation down the line.



[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line)

First off, at low frequency, the wire should reduce to our ordinary low frequency notion of a wire, maybe a little resistance, maybe Â little inductance, a little capacitance.

The common setup is to consider two lines, one grounded and one the signal line. Does this make sense? What about 1 line?

Duality and the speed of light.
