I've been watching Stephanie Weirich's lecctures on making a simple dependently typed language.

I was very excited about seeing a simple Haskell demo.

I feel the desire to abandon admittedly important subjects, like good error reporting (or any), but I feel that they are distracting away from the main point.

I currently feel that worrying about parsing takes to much time and attention away from the more interesting part. I'd rather just program directly in the Haskell Data structure.

This idea of bidirectional types has been floating around before. It gives extra annotation to typing rules to make them more algorthmic.

Type inference vs type checking.

Before I was not particularly differentiating these. And my languagesÂ had very explicit type annotations to help the checker more than the programmer.

I'm not sure if they are distracting away from the main point



Hindley-Milner makes sense. I need to implement it myself before I'm sure though.
