There is a standard hierarchy of numbers







Fin -> N -> Z -> Q -> R -> C







With very natural embeddings going back and forth.







Another 







Approximation theory: We are interested in fitting functions to data or to analytic ideals. Maybe we want a polynomial approximation to sine. How good is it? Which is the best one? Maybe we want and approximate polynomial solution to a differential equation. 







Optimization. We have an objective function that maps our state into a domain that.







Inclusion and optimization are connected. If we consider the value of the optimization problem representing the the sets of all values <= O, then inclusion and ordering on the reals correpond to the same thing. This is related to the epigraph transformation
