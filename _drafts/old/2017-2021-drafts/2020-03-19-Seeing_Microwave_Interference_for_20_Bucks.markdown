A few years back I was more into hacking around with raiod stuff, especially utilizing SDR (software defined radios). The RTL-SDR is a cheap  repurposed cable tv dongle that can act as a receiver for radio waves.







The Rtl has a limited range of frequencies and bandwidth it can receive. 







Install gqrx to get started. You can tool around, try to get an FM radio station working







The next stage is using Gnuradio. You can also access the raw stream in python or some other language.







3 Ghz has a wavelength of about 10 cm.







10Ghz has a wavelngth of 3cm. This is convenient for table top experiments
