There are fancier methods in Sakurai, Griffiths, Shankar.







The use case of the group theory techniques is to solve out difficult problems that have symmetry. We can work in a much smaller space. However, the methods are rather specialized and confusing. We can sort of run them in reverse and use our big hammer of eigenvalue solvers to derive the irreducible representations in the presence of group matrices.
