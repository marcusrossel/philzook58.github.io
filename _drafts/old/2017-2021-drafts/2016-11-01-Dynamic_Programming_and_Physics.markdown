Hyperbolic PDE.

The top-down approach is very interesting. You pull the value you want rather than push. It seems not inconceivable that this could be very useful, especially in infinite domains. You can't fill out the field in a data structure for infinite domains. Maybe you can assume that it starts at zero outside of some region. But sometimes things have nonzero tails
