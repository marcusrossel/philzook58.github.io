Lots of cool stuff







Dynamical Mode decompsoiton. Take xt and xt+1 and try to learn a linear dynamical model. Noe has some vareitaitonal method thing







Coarse grain learnint







Koopman operator and  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_operator) siomething to do with ergodic theorem?







Finding coordinate tyransformations to linearize a nonlinear system was evocative of zach's darboux polynomial thing.

Doesn't wasserstein distance seem relevant here.







Ok. What is the deal with machine learning







Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement. 







Regression. Making functional relationships. Probability vs not. Kullback-Leibler. Classification.







Generative?  GANs. An alternating quantifier formulation, like CEGAR. Boolean function learning.







Restricted Boltzmann machines. Graphical Models.







Manifold learning, dimensionality reduction







Hidden Markov models







Neural Networks







Decision Trees. Random Forests. Bagging. SVM. Nearest Neighbor. Kernel Methods.







Bias Variance Tradeoff. Regularization







Learning theory. Validation. Out of sample errors. Generalization. VC dimension.







Clustering. PCA. kMeans. ICA. SVD







Good uses of machine learning : Image recognition. Boosting speed with heuristics. Reinforcement learning (controlling video games. Cartpoles. Weird robots ). Learning dynamics. Renormalization flow?  Generating stuff (cool synthesized images). Labelling pieces of images. Infilling between frames, coloring, texture transfer, improving fluid sims. Deepfakes







Language. I don't know nothin bout this







Deepmind. Google AI. OpenAI
