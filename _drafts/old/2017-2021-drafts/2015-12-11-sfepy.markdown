Curious what is the best way to get my FEM on. I have tried this online

brew install hdf5

sudo pip install tables

brew install vtk5

brew reinstall --python --qt vtk5


Â echo /usr/local/opt/vtk5/lib/python2.7/site-packages >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/vtk5.pth


sudo pip install mayavi

Complains about missing stuff, I'll just install it if it doesn't work
