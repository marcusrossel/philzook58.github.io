OSQP, Casadi, mu-APC all code gen convex optimization solvers







Feldspar, ivory, copilot - interesting haskell code gen projects







Rust - At some level of completion







Straight up arduino. Maybe this is powerful enough? arudino with embedded accelerometer - arduino 101. Not sure if actually exists







STM32 - [https://leanpub.com/mastering-stm32](https://leanpub.com/mastering-stm32)  [https://os.mbed.com/platforms/](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/) arduino cubeMX, libopencm3. People have different priorities than me. I think I probably want the easiest one. Mbed with my disocvery board might be easy. Should I get a nucleo board







There was than open source repo project. platformio







FPGA  - all sorts of stuff going on. New boards. RISC5. Clash.
