We took an coursera AI course a while back that used 2048 as a problem which we approached with a more standard minimax approach.

That gives us the structure of the code for selecting moves and the game mechanics

To get started we'll just implement raw monte carlo tree search

There are some questions about what should be expanded and how

I think what we narrowed down on has a lot of repetition

I mean, since we aren't really gonna have a deepÂ  network, is this really alpha zero?
