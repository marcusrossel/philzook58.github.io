Dioids books, - Interesting idea of "linear" PDE in the max-plus state. POMDP perhaps? The interesting idea there that I gleaned was that the value function depends on your belief values. Hence even for a 2 state discrete system, it becomes a continuous problem on 2 parameters.







Maybe I shouldn't be lumping these things together







Matroids are a discrete structure. They obey axioms that are analogs of linear independence. That guy that kind of rubbed me the wrong way talked about how what I REALLY wanted was some matroid circuit thing.







Max-plus is a semiring. You can use it to make a bridge between linear algebra and shortest path problems.







The analog of convex problems.
