I learned a bit about arrows today. They're some sort of cousin to monads. Sort of they seem to abstract the notion of diagrams. I got (with a little help from the already solved example when I had weird type problems or something) a simple function wrapper working that is an instance of arrow

Can I use arrows for directed graphs? They'd have inputs and outputs.

Can I lift any monad to an arrow? Since the monad structure Â are kind of like redefining function application.

Can I vectorify arrows like piponi? Where the algebraic basis thing.

A thought: If you had a classical invertible boolean thing (a big invertible circuit) and then vectorified it, would that be a good analogy for whats going on in anyons? Only the ends represent state. Classical anyons is a viable labelling of the graph.

Types: Type checking is actually an interesting operation. When they says propistions = types and proofs = programs I think they may mean that proofs = type checking. Type checking (for a sufficiently complicated type system) might be turing complete so in that sense is programs. How do you type check?

Some tasks:

Reimplement Vector as described by Piponi. And the knot stuff. It's a long haul.

Include Kron product in the knotty thing

Make explicit that is implementing braided category

Should I be using arrows? (arrows actually have a notion of splitting? Is the cartesian pairing nature of splitting built into arrow or separate?)

Monads I think require a notion of time. You have to split your diagram with an ordering. I think Arrows may not

Also Knots. Huh. Tangles.

This vid is an interesting summary of stuff on his blog in 2008-ish. I like his emphasis on join as a way to compact up a double vectoring rather than concentrating on bind. I hadn't realized that before.
