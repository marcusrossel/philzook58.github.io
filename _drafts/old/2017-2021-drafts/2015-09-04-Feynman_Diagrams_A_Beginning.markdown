What are Feynman Diagrams?



Well obviously they are supposed to be evocative of the movements of particles. They visually encode all the ways that a process can happen, all the intermediate particles that could be have been created or destroyed. A picture of the messy soups that may occur between the nice clean in goes and out goes. So that is their physical interpretation in a nutshell. They are pictures of particles moving around and bouncing off one another.

We can think of a relative of Feynman diagrams that count probabilities. What is the probability of a Â getting to some target? Well, we can break it up into stages. The bee has a natural sort of random gait as it buzzes about. It probably walks somewhat like a drunkard (or we can pretend it does). But it also lands on flowers. We could breakdown the probability that a bee reaches Rose A by the processes where the Bee goes directly to rose A, visits B first, visits C first, visits Rose B and C, etc. By adding up the probability of all these possibilities, we get the total probability of the Bee getting to A.

Then there is a very robotic albeit complicated chart you can use to translate the pictures into mathematical expressions to calculate.

At a more abstract level, Feynman diagrams encode the perturbation expansion for the interactions between particles for the dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. Noninteracting particles are easy and solvable. The interactions can mostly only be treated approximately using your understanding of the noninteracting case as a bootstrapping bedrock. Every new twist and turn in the diagram is expressing a higher order of the perturbation expansion.

That's all well and good, but my personal favorite interpretation, the most abstract perhaps out of those I've said so far, is that Feynman diagrams are a notation for matrices.
