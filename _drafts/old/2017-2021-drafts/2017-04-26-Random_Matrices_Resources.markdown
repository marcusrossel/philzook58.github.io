Distinction between random media and random matrices - random media is more like a diaged random vector. Expectation value integral has appearance of a nonlinear qft term.Can be treated using same machinery. Interesting analogs of self energy, vertex functions, etc. (Datta mentions)

Jacobians of matrix decompositions can be computed and are central.

Eigenvalue decomp - Tend to be vandermonde determinants in eigenvalues

closed form Exists for LU, QR also.

Wigner semicircle - distribution of eigenvalues for large N matrix

Hermite polynomial expression for finite N



Applications:

Estimation of covariance matrix from data

Inverse problems?

Telecommunication
