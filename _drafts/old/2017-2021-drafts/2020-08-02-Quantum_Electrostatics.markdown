This is a thought that I had a few years ago that I think is fun to talk about.







Quantum Field Theory is somewhere about as fancy as it gets in physics. Quantum field theory is about describing the quantum dynamics of fields, by which we mean degrees of freedom that are sort of laid out in space. For every point in space, there is another degree of freedom. This is the sort of thing that is a reasonable way to describe a stretched membrane, where the height of the membrane at each point is the degree of freedom. Because points are so very small, fields have a tremendous number of degrees of freedom in totality.  A preposterous number. The thing that keeps this sane is basically some notion of energy. We only need to really look at the state space that corresponds to low energies, since there will by assumption never be enough energy to inject into the thing to access the high energy states. If we tried to do without this assumption, we hit nonphysicality problems. Almost every physical system that you can name stops behaving according to any fixed physical model you can name at some energy. The only possible exception to this may be some high energy particles, although looking at history it seems more likely that we have not yet found enough energy to blow these particles into their constituent bits. It is unknown if there is a bottom level to reality.







The wavefunction for the position of a single particle is visualizable, fairly intitutive, and tractable to analayze. The wavefunction is very similar in spirit to a probability distribution. 







Anyhow, the standard conception of quantum fields is as these very high degree of freedom things. There is a natural notion of a quantum electrostatic field that has illuminating analogies with this more complex notion. Consider an electron. This electron has a wavefunction. Anything we might measure about this electron has an amplitude associated with it. But this includes the simple $latex \hat{\phi(r)} = \frac{1}{|r - \hat{r}}$ coulomb potential. This is a family of quantum operators parameterized by the position $latex r$. It is a quantum field, however not one that possesses dynamics of its own. The state space remains that of a single particle. We can extend it to many particles by taking the sum of their coulomb potentials. The expectation value of $latex <\phi(r)>$ is the electrostatics potential of the probability distribution of the electron. Because the electron is actually in a superposition of being at exact positions and not just blobbed out, the field is fluctuating in some sense. We can differentiate this field to get the electric field at that position as an operator.
