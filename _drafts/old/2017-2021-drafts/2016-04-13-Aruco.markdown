ran calibration on my macbook pro camera.

Took a couple photos of the recommended checkerboard

found calibrate.py in the opencv source code

commented out the following line

#from common import splitfn

because I don't have common whatever that is.

Only needed with -debug argument

run the program like so

python calibrate.py images/*.jpg

got the result

RMS: 0.412602023891
