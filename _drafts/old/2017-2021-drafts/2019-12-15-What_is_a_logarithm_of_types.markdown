In the history of mathematics, new types of mathematical objects have been invented to solve problems. While just some random set of facts probably doesn't have nice properties, these objects do.







The counting number 1,2,3,... came first, then 0 and negative numbers.







It is a puzzle how to define a subtraction function in the naturals. One approach may be to define addition as a 3-way relation on the naturals. Then subtraction is . Thinking of addition as a function  that takes in 2 naturals and gives a third is fine. Thinking of subtraction that way is not clear







The same game can be played with multiplication and division.







The best possible approximation of a subtraction function available in the naturals is $latex x - y = max(0, x - y)$. In what sense is this a best approximation? The lifting this function into the integers describes a class of functions. If we use an absolute value norm .







The objective function defines an ordering on approximations. We run the objective function and that gives score. The score is a mapping in R. We then use the ordering in R. We can take the two polynomials and compare them insofar as they 







A canonical approximation problem is polynomial fitting. The context of a polynomial fitting problem is that we have a function space that is more expressive and a space of somewhat constrained polynomials. We want to find a polynomial that is the best fit in some sense.







There is a different perspctive 







Finite types modulo isomorphism are the same thing as the natural numbers. Questions and answers about the more intuitive domain of natural numbers 







Definitions of logarithm







  * The inverse of a power function
  * The integral of 1/t
  * Infinite power series $latex - \ln (1 - x) =  x + x^2/2 + x^3/4 + x^4/4 + ...$
  * Fitted curve
