My core model is that a functions should be thought of as vectors $latex \phi$, (partial) linear differential equation + boundary conditions should be thought of as a matrix L. "Source" terms appear as vector j in the equation $latex L\phi = j$. Solving this equation gives $latex \phi = Gj$  implying $latex G = L^{-1}$. The Green's "function" is this matrix G. In the basis where $latex \phi$ nd j are represented basically as samples on a grid, the columns of G correspond to the solutions of point sources. The matrix vector multiplication is the linear superposition of all the influence of point sources.







However there are perhaps important aspects of differential equations and Green's functions that are not captured by this model. This is a very numerical perspective. Sometimes we are interested in closed form solutions, analytical solutions, and fourier/laplace transform techniques.







The model does have a useful and concrete discussion of series solutions to green's functions. These are equivalent to series solutions for the inverse of a matrix.







The model has an extension that does explain the relation of green's functions and correlation functions. The data of a multidimensional Gaussian integrand can be stored in matrices and vectors. The generating function of a Gaussian integral contains the inverse of the matrix of coefficients. The multidimensional moments of the Gaussian are built out of combinations of this matrix.







I should find that Lyx document.

In the field of physics, there is a tendency to call many things Green's functions. There is truth in the naming, but also intense untruth. 







The things called Green's functions are usually intensely related and there is power of analogy to pointing that out. The same or similar mathematical techniques and facts can be used to







Similarly all the following names could be used to refer to each other







The core mathematics: Linear partial differential equations can be analyzed and solved via using the techniques of  linear algebra. Linear algebra is a field with very strong computational teeth.

I should give a talk on Algerba of Programming?
