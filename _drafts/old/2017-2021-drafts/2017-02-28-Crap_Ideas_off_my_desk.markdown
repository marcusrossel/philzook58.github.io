Bosonization wire construction + low rank matrix (fast multipole expansion of log). Is that a good numerical use of bosonization

Free Anyons - Find H that maintains pure "product" Â structure like slater determinant.

OPE and hierarchical Matrices. Hierarchical Matrix Compression. H-matrix DMRG

Haskell Matrices = Recursive blockwise definition rather than list or array based. Vectors as trees rather than lists.

Van Emde Boas Tree log (log (M)) Combine somehow with sparse vector?

Polarization and the QHE. Use functional integral of plasma analogy and polarization.

Nonlinear Circuit topological mode (Reality condition of real circuits is kind of like Time reversal symmetry)

J source terms Schur complement canonical formulation. Functional differentiation.

Edge = Schur complement of bulk

Linear dispersion = schur complement of sinusoidal

Superconductor + QHE lattice ~ topological circuit?

Wavelet multipole expansion & OPE.

Boolean circuit lattice and frustration

Lattice bosonization

Periodic potential linear dispersion.

elasticity as metric coupling. Bosonization of it $partial_x$ grabs terms via chain rule. Hall viscosity. Measurement

Lot's of stuff on computation anyons.

Nonlinear electrostatics

Anyon rules as beta reduction

Probability as beta reduction. Conditional probability as function. Integration(marginalization) Sampling as unfold. metafunctions on distributions. P(x | y)P(y) also has form of dependent product. kind of (type of snd depends on fst). These notions may not be compatible. variables as types. actual measurements as inhabitants of those types. (relation to functional structure of neural nets).

Type versus inhabitant: analogy to physics quantity vs actual ability to measure quantity? quantum LEM. LEM says that things are either true or false. That the truth is written out there in the great book if if we can't figure it out. No LEM requires method by which to obtain proof. Constructive. Middle ground of not measured things are supposed to be in quantum superposition? I dunno. I'm talking nonsense. I hope that talking nonsense is a method by which to stop talking nonsense eventually.
