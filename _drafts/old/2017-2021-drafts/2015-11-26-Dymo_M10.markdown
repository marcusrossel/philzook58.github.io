Trying to get readings from Dymo scale on a mac.

Not immediately working.

This does list the device





Screw it. Macs Suck. Lets go linux. Getting code to work on a mac is just a teensy harder always.

This code does work.

Had some trouble with permission denied errors, access denied, and resource busy errors until I added the unload kernel drivers line and ran using sudo (which was unsuccessful for fixing on a mac. Got a segfault when I tried it) .



    
    import usb.core
    import usb.util
    import time
    
    VENDOR_ID = 0x0922
    PRODUCT_ID = 0x8003
    
    # find the USB device
    device = usb.core.find(idVendor=VENDOR_ID,
                           idProduct=PRODUCT_ID)
    
    # use the first/default configuration
    time.sleep(1)
    
    if device.is_kernel_driver_active(0):
            try:
                    device.detach_kernel_driver(0)
                    print "kernel driver detached"
            except usb.core.USBError as e:
                    sys.exit("Could not detach kernel driver: ")
    else:
            print "no kernel driver attached"
    #device.()
    device.set_configuration()
    # first endpoint
    endpoint = device[0][(0,0)][0]
    
    # read a data packet
    attempts = 10
    data = None
    while data is None and attempts > 0:
        try:
            data = device.read(endpoint.bEndpointAddress,
                               endpoint.wMaxPacketSize)
        except usb.core.USBError as e:
            data = None
            if e.args == ('Operation timed out',):
                attempts -= 1
                continue
    
    print data
