The landscape of FFI is rather confusing

Basically you can do it all manually.

hsc2hs is a part of ghc

c2hsÂ  - does more for you. Auto makes a lot of foregin C-type info. Enums, structs and stuff.

inline-c is useful and easy enough if you are calling functions that take standard types or Arrays of them.

inline-c is sort of meant for run and gun type scenarios.



Example using inline-c to bind to the NAG library (a C numerical library)

Basically, The easiest thing is to use Vecs and use the C style where you pass in a pointer for the modified variablle.

You can make muttable Vecs easily on the haskell side and then hand them in using C-inline.
