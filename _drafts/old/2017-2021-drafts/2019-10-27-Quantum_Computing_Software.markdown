Will says I should be intersted in quantum computing.







Interesting things to say about superconductivity. I would like seeing a exact diagonalization demonstrating something.







What else: Simulation?

Talk about josephson junctions. Yeah they are nonlinear inductors.







Talk about algorithms







Talk about super optimization. Combinatorial exploration of all possible configs.

Ok. You've got a basic set of gates.




X,Y, Z Rotate by $latex pi$ about that axis




$latex S^\dagger$ is a $latex pi/2$ rotation about Z




T is a $latex \pi/4$ rotation about Z




You should be able to hit delete and delete the gate. Dragging it into a trash can sucks.




I am not sure how to make the "Quantum Sphere" show anything.
