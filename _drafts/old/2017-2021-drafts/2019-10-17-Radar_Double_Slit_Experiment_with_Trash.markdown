I bought the stuff a long whiles back







You can get these really cheap radar modulkes that put out 13Ghz. They are actually doppler units that can be used for speed measurements.







You can also get downconverters for saterllite tv really cheap. Oh The freuqencies are abhot the same?







The RTL-SDR dongles have decmocratized sdr. You can get one for 10 bucks. It's a bad but perfectly functional SDR unit for 50Mhz - 1.5Ghz ish. It's nuts.







When I was a physics TA, we had this PASCO lab that used a microwave source on a goniometer. We can replicate this easily using readily available hobbyist junk.
