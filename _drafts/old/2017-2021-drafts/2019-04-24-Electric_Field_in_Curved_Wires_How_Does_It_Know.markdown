Circuits are the most comfortable, precision, well understood physical system that exists. Optics is a close second.







But still there are some questions that upon further reflection are surprising and confusing.







Electrostatics is can feel conceptually very straightforward, but is very confusing when it meets reality. 







A way transmits current because of an electric field from somewhere (a fishy notion). 







The standard constitutive relation (Ohm's law) reads







$latex J = \sigma E$   








J going out of the surface is 0. So also the electric field going out of the surface should be zero on the interior of the wire.
