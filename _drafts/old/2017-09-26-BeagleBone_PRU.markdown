The PRU (programmable real time unit) is something that has been on my to do list for a while. They are processors on the Beaglebone that can be independently programmed and talked to while the main processor is running linux. Supposedly you can toggle a pin at 200Mhz using these PRUs.



plug the beaglebone into your usb port

you can ssh inÂ  with

ssh root@beaglebone.local

This is good. Just blindly follow it.

I had to comment out the load data section in the c coade to get it to compile. I have old version of prussdrv.h?
