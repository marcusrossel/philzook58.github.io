    "Ok, we've painted a rosy picture so far. Obviously CBMC does not scale to arbitrarily large and difficult problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic technique is to unwind them. All is not lost, many loops (for loops in particular) can be completely unwound. You can add `--unwinding-assertions` to know if you've covered all possible executions. Ever if you can't, passing these chekcs does give you some confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going to the next level there is also the ability to add invariant annotations. I'm not sure if CBMC can infer these successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "On bigger problems, I've had some success fiddling with the \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting thing to note is that CBMC is a limitted termination checker. If your function has a bound on the number of iterations, `--unwinding-assertions` can determine that there is nothing that crosses the bound. This may be usefulfor checking uppper bounds of possible loop iterations which can matter in realtime contexts. Another thing this could be useful for is checking eBPF programs, which are required to have a determinstic bound, usually enforced by requiring an acyclic control flow graph.\n",
