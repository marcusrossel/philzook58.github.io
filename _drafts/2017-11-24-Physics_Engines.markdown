Discrete time and space?
Allow some overlap?
Collisions using force fields

Reduce everything to points
Reduce everything to AABB
Model paths as R -> R? But then how to 
FRP?
Hierarchy of scales?
Collisions as discrete events is tough

Organizational scheme
Use classes?
collide(A,B)? return point? true/false? region included in both? AABB? Maximal AABB?
inside(x,A) ? point query?

javascript AD. Forward mode prob. No overloading sucks.
