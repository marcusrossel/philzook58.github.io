There is something qute anjyable and compelling about building mechanisms.

Many years ago we bought a 3d printer kit. It was quite illuminating to see the basic trcks and pieces one could buy or build. It s still very common to see RAMPS boards, gear belt, couplers, steppers, and aluminum extrusion. You can transfer these techniques to other projects.

Having a guided experience makes it way less painful

We tried last year to build a basic escapement mechanism by just winging it. It was hilariously bad. At the least, it seems like one must design it to not hav a positive where the tooth gear can spin freely.

Got a ROKR kit clock.

The ratchet mechanism was cool. There was an inner vortex looking wheel tht cannot spin freely, but because it is wheel, these vortex arms can bend.

The way of building gears was cool. Wood on wood is not a good gear material, also they are pretty warped, which is why the smaller gears are doubly thick.
One of my more popular blog posts was describing how to draw gears in onshape.

Axles and spacers

How do escapements work. A pendulum swings and that s a nce time keeping elements. The swinging of the pendulum is both powered by the escapement and also rate limits the rotatng of the escapement wheel. This wheel is gear up to the powr source and then to the actual clock hands. The minute and hour hand are gear together in a ratio of 12:1 (1 rotation of the minute hand is 1/12 a rotatin of the hour hand)

A cool thing  recall is that you want the period of the pendulum swing to be decuopled from the rest of the clock., in particular the amount of force the spring is applying. As I recall, there is an argument you want to touch the pendulum only at the apex of the swing if possible.
