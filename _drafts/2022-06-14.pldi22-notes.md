It went very nice.

## Notes

Checked C
https://github.com/URSEC/checkedc-tutorial-pldi22

new PL - rust. but we gotta get that legacry C code

convert to checked-C

out of bound - 

temporal memory safeyy - usae aftr free double free invalid free

_Ptr<> - no pointer artihemtic or subscript operatro
_Array_ptr<T>
_Nt_array_ptr<T>


null pointer check inseted by compiler

_array_ptr<> p : count(bounds_exp) = ...;
gives bound. Removes dynamic check if it can 

upper and lower bounds 
_Array_ptr<int> p1 : bounds(p0, p0 + BUF_LEN/2)

Nt_array_ptr pointing to null terminated 
_Nt_array_ptr<char> p0 : count(5) = "12345";

automaitc bounds widening
if (*p == 'a') {
    /// now I know p[0] wasn't null
}


checked regions
_Checked
only chfked pointers allowed. "a formal model of checked C"

_unchecked. force compiler to omit checking
similar to rust undage

#pargama CHECKED_SSCOPE on
all code is checked


Bounds safe interface

itype interoperation type. Can be checkd or unchecked
char *dst : itype(_Array_ptr<char>)

dynamic bound check
dynamics_bounds_cast<T>()



itype "is a forall"?

Question: Can I use any C compiler?


3C 
whle program static analyis infer bounds
interactive  annotation of C programs
OOPSLA '22
typ3c . Ccured Cqual. chk wild pointer. how is it used ptr, arr ntarr
root cause analysis
modular checked pointer identificatin
bound3c inferring bounds
correlation analysis - locksmith finding daya races

ptr and array_ptr have subtyping relationship

clang tools https://clang.llvm.org/extra/index.html

adds intializers

require annotations? Are those dynamic checks?
_assume_bounds_cast
itype are not safe

formal semantics of llvm

2 functions src and tgt
tries to prove tgt is optimizaed version of source

mul --> shl

dsl for all bitwidthcs in alive

bitwdith indepndent proofs

How does it work?
Could it be llvm independent?

counterexample simplification loop

rust has unchecked usigned

outlining? as compared to inlining. for code size.
... huh

more rfefined
undefined behavior

 making partial things total
 Hmm.
 undef - adversarial vs optimization.

each ssa use of undef can return different values

poison is contagious. supports speculation
it lives outside the values
vector poison 
2017 paper


Make sure my thing works offline

compiler to llvm

noundef 

superoptimization
Minotaur

divide by zero

  (1/x) = 3 refines 1/x = undef.

  if (x = 0) then 1/x = undef else 1/x=1/x
  egraph containment?

  We'd need to case on x... hmmm.
  

  x = 0 xor neq(x,0)
  neq(eq(x,0),neq(x,0)). Hmm, the group thing?
  We can throw this in the
  bool != bool 
  eq(x,0) != neq(x,0)
  
  eq(x,0) = eq()
  This is stupid.
  Do the undef splitting at meta level?

### Ian Briggs -

enode extraciton
- extract every enode in eclass.
- what was that about f(?x)? This seems key and I didn't get it
- it does feel eggloggy. directly manpulation
- symettries - group union find

s(f(t(x))) transformations
discover expressions that contain f?


### Yihong
congruence add(a,b) -> c
Great talk. Too adrenalined up to listen too closely, but it seemed like an excellent presentiation of the relational <-> egraph relationsip

### Nadia
Tree automata?

egraphs 
equality constrained tree automata

compactly reprsetned constrained term spaces

dnumerate the dpace.
tyoe druven program synthesis
hoogle+

set of terms
not equivalent. Just two things.
Sets of terms
add constraints at enodes?
"reverse de bruijn notation"

any(x) holding all choices. 
any(1) = any(2)

Any = Var in reverse de bruijn
You can encode SAT?
# Remy
VSA 
tree automata

## tactic for proof assitant

instantiate from context.
1 -> (- a a)

Rewrite rules can't go both ways because of 
1 = sub(a,a) :- term(a).

json 
rewrites work on logical equivalences. Equivalence is equality on bools or prop.
