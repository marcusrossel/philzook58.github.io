The most straightforward computational attack on homotopy is usuing a trinagulated mesh that I think is fairly intuitive to computer people

Computerizing something involes:
- how to you even represent the thing you want to talk about
- howw do you actually compute answers to interesting questions. I divide these into differewnt classes 1. Just recognize something, i.e.e proof checking or 2. Calculate or find something, i.e. actual numerical computations or proof finding or what have you. 1. Is often an interesting thing to start with since it is easier even if what you really want is 2.


Paths are lists of adjacent vertices.

Using haskell gadts for example, we can encode all the paths and then use the types to enforce that the path is actually connected.


Another persepctive on this is to encopde the proerties of the mesh in logic, like first order logic.
Z3 is a way to make this conrete


From the perspective of systems like Coq or agda, these two pictures become the same thing. There systems have the notion of inductive predicates that boil down to defining a datatype like that in Haskell.


It sucks to work with this stuff though.



A second straightforward attack to model homotopy would be to directly model functions from the interval
R -> R.
Reals are floats.


We might try to directly model these things in functions and use functional programming
def homo1():

```python
def composepath(p1,p2):
  assert(p1(1) == p2(0) )
  def res(t):
    if t < 0.5:
      return p1(2 * t)
    else:
      return p2(2*t-1)
  return res
```

Skeletonizing this path with an open cover.
1 open cover = [0,1) and (0,1]


Or we might try to take a more symbolic approach, like using sympy or some custom dsl.
The difference here is tha6t in many languages, lambdas are basically totally opaque. There are advantages and disadvenmtages to 
this rule. It does not have to be so. Languages with strong metaprogramming paradigms 
(and I include lisps, Julia, and coq here) let you poke around in the guts to varying degrees.

Reals as floats may be objectionable to your sensibiliuties. Then perhaps a preferable approach may be to use exact reals, numbers that retain the capacity to be computed to arbitrary precision upon request.


Maybe there is more connection to my path thing than I realezied




Higher inductive types are where it is actually at I guess.

https://pure.itu.dk/portal/files/84649948/icfp19main_p164_p.pdf - ICFP cubical agda, a depdently typed programming language with higher inductive types. Interestingly, from Mertberg's demo, I feel like the emphasis was not on cubical itself. More interested in standard HoTT they just want it to be better


HoTT - quotients supposedly? Fractions? Integers vs naturals. I guess that's the zeroth.
Or maybe True / False modulo True = False?

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04391 - de moura selsam. good explanation of equality type
John Major equality - conor mcbride
Doing raw recursor proofs. Can I do it? I feel like it's kind of straightforward.
Begin able to write out exactly where I want the equality applied via a lambda. 
Could Axiomatize equality rather than use Inductive definition.
The pattern match of a HIT must desguar into recursors?


Types are spaces.
values are points
dependent types are fibrations
identity types are paths


Other weirdness:
Observational type theory

Describing a concrete simplex as a gadt.
How do you make a correct by construction data structure of a path?
A list of vertices. Fine. But is there a path between each of them?
Ok, list of edges. Do those edges meet?

univalence let's you turn isomorphisms into equality and get isomorphisms out of equalities.

HIT - Higher inductive types. Instead of always needing the data constructor to end with the type itself A , now it can end with =_A also. You can do this using

recursors. Patrern matching is cool,. but it can be desgared into something else. A function that takes a continuation for each case of the type.

focus on inclusion and projection maps of the basic simplex

Cubical Sets.

of of the basic interval.

Simpilical Sets.

By using the basic simplex with its inclusion maps as sort of a index into your complex, you can grab all n-simplices at once. This is a Functor relation.

Great intro

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.4221

You can use a postulate methodology where you slam out all the pieces of your type as axioms

Dan Licata explaining how to use hiding to implement HIT. You export an interface. This let's you postulate less

You always need streicher K and rewriting turned on. What do these do?

https://homotopytypetheory.org/2011/04/10/just-kidding-understanding-identity-elimination-in-homotopy-type-theory/

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39239363/what-is-axiom-k/39256457

Axiom K is Uniqeness of Identity Proofs. Default pattern matching allows this. Modified pattern matching doesn't. The recursor form doesn't seem to have this problem

Kind of hard to navigate. Like the std-lib but harder.

Useful start in core. Check out univalence, check out the types folder. Look at the normal types like Bool, Nat, List. Now check out Circle, Torus,
