What do you actually do:
Look at the spec sheet and copy the example circuit.

# Circuits
It is surprising and confusing how good people get at electronics without persay being very mathemtical about it.
Some of it is pattern recognition

Circuits are not functions. They are relations
The delusion of perfect sources

## Op Amps
The golden rule.

Integrators
Differentiators

## Transistors
BJT
MOSFET

biasing

Golden rules

Current mirror

## 555 Timer chips


# Analyses
Node and mesh

Laplace transform. Because we care about impulse response



# Oscillators

# Filter Networks
Matrices


# Transmission Lines


# Radio
Models of antenna

Circuits aren't the circuits you think they are. Shit gets messy

Modulation
Multipliers

SDR
Complex signals

A little bit this kind of thing is just for fun. You can get insanely powerful micorcontrollers for cheap.
You could argue maybe for simplicity or speed or parallelism.
Serial latch

Art of electronics - didn't really like this one.
ARRL handbook is really good actually
