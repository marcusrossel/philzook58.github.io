# de Bruijn

de bruijn as summarization of eval/zipper context

Weirdo maude mixed de bruijn and named. Structured identifiers `'x', 1` or both a name and de bruijn. You only need to lift when you cross a name clash.

de bruin has some tricky points

# Locally Nameless

Probably the canonical technique.

# Named

# Scope Graphs

# Co-debruijn

Map -style. This one is new to me. Conor Mcbride's Everybody's got the be somewhere mentions this. At every lambda, you hold a map of where those variables end up going. This leads to a lot of duplication of structure, but it makes sense. Even de Bruijn indices are a peculiar indirection. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04085.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04085.pdf)

Yes so, Semantic of de bruijn
z really is a projection function from a tuple
s is a reduction function ignoring
They really use polymorphism to achieve what they need here.
i + l = n levels plus indices = number of binders.
I can be wokring in Fock space for homogenous operators.
Simon here shows a homogenous list based semantics.

What do we do with binders?

[https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/edwardk/bound](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/edwardk/bound)

Do Just dumbass names

    <code>data Lambo = Var String | Lam String Lambo | App lambo Lambo
    
    -- nope i fucked this up. lordy
    -- You need to alpha rename if x contains s' as a free var
    subst (Lam s' b) s x | s == s' = (Lam s' b)
                         | otherwise = Lam s' (subst b s x)
    subst (Var s') s x | s == s' = x
                       | otherwise = Var s'
    subst (App f x) s x = App (subst f s x) (subst f s x) 
    
    but then we want to be lazy about substituions.
    
    
    eval :: Lambo -> Lambo
    eval (App f x) = let x' = eval x in 
    eval (App (Lam s b) x) = eval (subst b s x)
    eval (App f x) | reducible f = let f' = eval f in eval f' x -- if we also let x' = eval x  it is cbv
                   | otherwise = (App f x) 
    eval x = x</code>

Well typed de bruijn. [http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/interp.html](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/interp.html)

Chris mentioned [https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/christian.urban/Publications/nom-tech.pdf](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/christian.urban/Publications/nom-tech.pdf) nominal forms in isabelle. I don't know what this is

Locally nameless. Separate free and bound variables. Conor Mcbride and Charuand paper

Point-free style. Does my point-free guide hold some stuff about binding forms?

I had some notes I was doing for indexful differentiation. Tensor expressions. It was an interesting exercise

Differentiation is syntactic, not semantic. That's why is sucks so hard in thermo

Differential is a binding form itself. See a comment in Functional Differential geometry and in Plotkin's talk.

[https://github.com/sweirich/challenge/blob/canon/debruijn/debruijn1.md](https://github.com/sweirich/challenge/blob/canon/debruijn/debruijn1.md)

In locally nameless we don't have to shift on the term we're substituting in since the free variables in the term have names.
