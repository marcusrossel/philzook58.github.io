How to calculate things
1. taylor series. We often have these in closed form. We can bound errors using remainder theorem (The error of a taylor series is bounded by the maximum value the next term can take over the interval). If nothing else, taylor series can boot strap other methods by using them to define arbitrary precision approximations.
2.

Dyadic rationals = $$ m \times 2^d $$. These are an idealized model of floating point. They can add, subtract, and multiply exactly.

ULP - Unit in Last place. a measure of how accurate an fp calculation is. 0.5 ulp is the best you can do for approximating an antagonisitcally chosen number.

# Range reduction
Powers of 2 are often easier to handle seperately, leaving behind a problem

exp = 2^(log_2(e) * x)

sin/cos don't matter modulo 2 pi. modulo pi for some signs.

# 2Sum and Fast2Sum

Compensated summation
Exact roundoff in floating point addition.
From an information perspective, taking two 64 bit numbers into 1 is lossy? Well, yeah but so what?
What if you kept an entire error tape?
You can't get exact roundoff

You can get exact errors. If you try to keep doing this, the error terms keep growing in size though.
(a + (b + c)) gets two seperate error terms. Exact addition of these gives you exact error.

Fused multiply add let's you obviously get the exact error of a multiplication
```
x = o(a * b)
err = o(a*b - x)
```

[kahan summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm)
[pairwise summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_summation) simple divide and conquer summation.

## Veltkamp splitting
You can split a float into 2 floats that add together to it precisely. This is useful sometimes
## Dekker Multiplication
Exact error can be represented in floating point for floating point multiplication

## Newton Raphson
## Multiplication by arbitrary precision number like pi
Compute a hgh and low part of the number
Ch = RN(C)
Cl = RN(C - x)


## Error Models
https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/epsilon-delta.html

o(x op y) = (x op y)(1 + e)
e <= u




## Sterbenz lemma
Addition and subtraction are exact if the numbers are really close to each other. (A factor of 2)
