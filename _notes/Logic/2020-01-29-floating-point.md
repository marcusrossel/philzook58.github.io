[Linkes to dd arithmetic](https://twitter.com/hypergeometer/status/1493976347177275394?s=20&t=HpXMueCpbbces3-09fMYhw). dd+d and qd+d. airthemtic. Ball arithemtic using float formats for everything? double double arithemtic. using two doubles to represent and one double for ballradius. Sometimes you need to go to higher precision to correctly round. So 2 doubles is attarcive sine 128bit floas rarely exist in hardware

Herbie is super cool.
1. you can just do rancom sampling to estimate errors, with extreme multiprecision accuracy and regular. Dynamic analysis in a sense?
