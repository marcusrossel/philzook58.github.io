Linear logic is resource sensitive. It is vaguely similar to
- Rust lifetimes
- Quantum information nad the no-cloning theorem

Can these be made precise?

It is realted to seperation logic in that both are substructural logics and in 

It gives interesting insight into the proof search process of prolog and ilk.

Frank Pfenning had a funky example involving making change.

What if I modelled destructive rewrite rules in egglog as linear logical?
Is a linear logic programmign langguae a good candidate for a prolog metainterpreter?
