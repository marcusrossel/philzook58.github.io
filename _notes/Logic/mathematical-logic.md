# Well formed formula



# Lowenheim Skolem 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem
For infinite models, there are always bigger and smaller models.


Lindstrom's theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolem%27s_paradox Skolem's paradox.
Set theory says there are uncountable sets, but set theory is expressed in countable language


# Semantic entailment
`|=` is used in different ways

`G |= x`. G is a set of formula. This is to say that every model in which G hold, x also holds

`G, not x |= {}` is unsat.

# Soundness
G |- x  --> G |= x

Syntactic rules are obeyed in models.


# Completeness
G |= x --> G |- x

# Compactness
Infinite families of sentences

# Consistency


# Incompleteness Theorem

# Misc
