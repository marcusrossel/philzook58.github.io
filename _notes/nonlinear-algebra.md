By nonlinear algebra I mean things relating to multivariate polynomials

# Linear modelling of nonlinear systems
## Vandermonde Matrix
The big question: Linear in what?
You can always determine a polynomial as a linear algebra problem given sample points. A polynomial can bethought of as linear in it's _coefficients_


## Companion Matrix
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_matrix)
A matrix designed to have characterstic polynomial

## Sylvester matrix

# Univariate Polynomials
We're really good at these.
Fundamental theorem of algebra

## Homotopy Continuation
## Grobner Bases


## Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD)

## NLSAT

# Modules
Linear algebra but wih rings instead of fields. You can't divide by scalars anymore.
