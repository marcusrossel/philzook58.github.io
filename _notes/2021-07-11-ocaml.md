### Extensible Variants
Extensible variants allow you to add new constructors to a data type kind of imperatively. They let data types be open. They are a strong relative of exceptions in ocaml (maybe even the same thing now) which have let you add new exception cases for a long time.
They give a new axis upon which to consider data type definitions problems. Ordinary data types are closed in Ocaml. It is easy enough to check for pattern matching coverage because of that. Going Finally Tagless is a classic technique for achieving a kind of open-ness to the data type.

They are distinct from [polymorphic variants](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/variants.html#scrollNav-4). This is a point that has confused me in the past, although not any more! They are actually pretty different. Wait. Are they that different?

It is extra intriguing or bizarre that they can be GADTs. Because of this, they can be used as type witnesses of various flavors which facilitates a kind of dependently typed programming and/or heterogenous data structures.

Using the first class module system, you can also dynamically add new cases as runtime. How crazy is that!

Basic type witnesses

```ocaml
type _ ty = ..
type _ ty += Int : int ty
type _ ty += Bool : bool ty
type _ ty += List : 'a ty -> 'a list ty
```

<https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/trep.ml> - Oleg Kiselyov describing this technqiue

You can build a heterogenous data structure by packing together with it's type witness
```ocaml
type univ = {ty : 'a ty; x : 'a}
type hlist = univ list

let example : hlist = [ {ty = Int; x = 3}; {ty = Bool; x = true} ]
```

You can similarly build dictionaries and such.

You can also have anonymous keys. Instead of destructuring a type like above, you just get the ones that you register.

<https://github.com/janestreet/base/blob/master/src/type_equal.ml> In the Jane-Street Base library you can find some of these techniques embedded. Look in the `Witness` module

- <https://sites.google.com/site/ocamlopen/> - Leo White's page on extensible variants
- <https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/publications/PPDP06.pdf> - Open Data Types and Open Functions
- <https://ocaml.org/manual/extensiblevariants.html> The Ocaml manual is actually quite good.

### Extensible Functions

As part of extensible data types, you might also desire extensible functions. When you add a new case to the datatype, you need to probably add a new handling case to functions that match over this type. These can be simulated using references and mutation. See the Kiselyov example <https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/trep.ml>

If you have metaocaml activated, you can do some of this type manipulating stuff at compile time. You then have a rather satisfyingly flexible system for typelevel programming.

Question: What is the runtime manifestation of adding a case to a type?
Ref cell techniques let you do some funky looking stuff from the eyes of a pure functional programmer. There is a great deal in SICP using this technique and it is part of lisp tradition. If you close over a a single ref cell with a bunch of closures, this collection of closures becomes in essence a kind of object manipulating an internal protected state. One common use case for this is to implement a counter object, which is useful for generating fresh symbols (sometimes called a gensym).

Extensible variants I suspect actually have a dynamic runtime effect. Declaring an extensible variant creates a runtime representation (a counter and perhaps a table) which gets incremented whenever you declare a new constructor. No it doesn't, unless the call goes into the runtime maybe? But `type foo += Gary` is a runtime effectful thing that does have code.
Declaring an ordinary closed datatype allows everything to pretty much be done at compile time and a great deal is erased


Anyhow

```ocaml
let extensible_function = ref (fun success fail -> fail ())
let add_case g = let f = !extensible_function in
                 extensible_function := fun success fail ->
                  g success (fun () -> f success fail)

```

This is a linked list like lookup table. Not very efficient.
We can instead use perhaps a hashtable or dictionary as our key access.

### Build System

I have used dune for a long time. It's great. It's so good that I've never really worked with the raw ocaml build system. This is bad. Stuff doesn't always go right, so it's good to know how things work.

All the ocaml tools: <https://ocaml.org/manual/comp.html>
- ocamlc - batch compiler
- ocaml - a repl
- ocamlrun - runtime system (for bytecode output)
- ocamldep 
- 


ocamlc takes many kind of arguments and does things based on their file suffix
ocamlc needs to take in the modules in their topological order. If you try out of order it will fail

-linkall What is it.

ocamlc main.ml -> main.cmi, main.cmo, a.out
a.out is a bytecode executable. `file` reveals it runs ocamlrun. `head a.out` shows a hash bang for ocamlrun 

ocamlfind, META files. <http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/findlib-1.9.1/doc/guide-html/c74.html>
- `ocamlfind list` all known packages
- `ocamlfind query` 
- `ocamlfind ocamlc -package foo` will add the appropriate includes to ocamlc `-linkpkg` adds also the file names
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/cmo-specification/4112 cmo file format

ocamlopt main.ml -> main.cmx main.

`-i` print all defined things.
`-S` output assembly

https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/2.5/manual/overview
js_of_ocaml - i really needed to output it with main.bytes? No no. I needed to give it the byte _exectuable_. This is the result of the ocamlc compiler

# Modules

https://ocaml.org/manual/moduleexamples.html#

What are modules?
- kind of like files
- kind of like records
- "compilation units"

Functors are "dependently typed" in some ways in that the signature of the output can depend on the types in the actual module of the input

### Modules vs Typeclasses

### First Class Modules
http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/first-class-modules/

### Higher Kinded Polymorphism
In Haskell, one is used to parametrizing over (Functor f), (Monad f) etc.
It is not directly possible to refer to an unapplied type constructor in ocaml. 

https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/higher-kinded-polymorphism/2192
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L28/10-monads-notes.pdf


Analogy with typeclasses (not that this is how you should think about it)
- superclass constraints = module inclusion
- type parameters = type in module. Really associated types https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families#An_associated_data_type_example
- methods of class = values of module

For two type parameters
Reader s a do we bundle them or not?
module type READER
    type s
    type 'a t
end


# GADTs
- https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L28/07-gadts-notes.pdf

For me this is more familiar territory

# Registries


# Typelevel programming
Here's a fun gizmo.


A thing that disturbs me about OCaml modules compared to Haskell typeclasses is that it is not clear how to use them to build something that manipulates types.
Typeclasses instance declarations are a kind of restricted typelevel prolog.

```haskell
data Nat = Succ Nat | Zero
class Plus(a,b,c) where

instance Plus `Zero y y where
instance Plus x y z => Plus (`Succ x) y (`Succ z) where
```

```prolog
plus(zero, Y, Y).
plus(succ(X),Y,succ(Z)) :- plus(X,Y,Z)
```

You can achieve this in ocaml using gadts.

```ocaml
type 'a succ
type zero
type (_,_,_) plus =
  | PZero : (zero, 'a, 'a) plus
  | PSucc : ('x, 'y, 'z) plus -> ('x succ, 'y, 'z succ) plus
```

Gadts are however unmoving. You will need to build the evidence

```ocaml
type _ snat =
    | SZero : zero snat
    | SSucc : 'a snat -> 'a succ snat
type ('x, 'y) eplus = EPlus of 'z snat * ('x,'y,'z) plus
let plus : forall x y. x snat -> y snat -> (x, y) eplus
```

Modules themselves are kind of their own dependent type system bolted on.
They are dependent in the sense that modules may contain module signatures. A Functor that takes in a module may refer to this module signature in the type of it's result

```coq
Record Wrapper := {
    T : Type
    v : T
}.

Definition unwrap (x : Wrapper) : x.(T) := x.(v).
```

```ocaml
module type Wrapper = sig
    module type T
    module v : T
end

module UnWrap (X : Wrapper) : X.T = X.v
```

We can also use the finally tagless style as an alternative to the GADT style `(_,_,_) plus` above. It is sometimes said that finally tagless achieves what GADTs do in more ordinary ocaml.
The finally tagless signature is the pattern matching function. Actually it isn't quite. We should quantify over repr.

```coq
Inductive Plus : nat -> nat -> nat -> Type :=
    | PZero : forall y, Plus 0 y y
    | PSucc : forall x y z, Plus x y z -> Plus (Succ x) y (Succ z)
    .

Print Plus_rec.
(*   *)

Fixpoint plus_rec (x y z : nat) (repr : nat -> nat -> nat -> Type) (p : Plus x y z) (pzero : repr 0 y y) (psucc : repr -> ) : repr x y z :=
    match p with
    | PZero => repr 0 y y
    | PSucc p => 
    end
```

```ocaml
module type PLUS = sig
    type (_,_,_) repr
    val pzero : (zero, 'y, 'y) repr
    val psucc : ('x, 'y, 'z) repr -> ('x succ, 'y, 'z succ) repr
end

module Gadt : PLUS = struct
    type ('a,'b,'c) repr = ('a,'b,'c) plus
    let pzero = Pzero
    let psucc p = PSucc p
end
```
