$ F(a;b;c,z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_n (b)_n}{(c)_n} \frac{z^n}{n!} $

The ratio of subsequent terms is rational. This implies that it has a factorial representation?

WZ pair. What's up with that

Gosper's algorithm. It's not that complicated?

Many common functions are hypergeometric. What's up with that?
