# What are Hybrid systems
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_system)
Continuous and discrete dynamics

## Examples
- Bouncing balls
- Walking robots (contact with ground)
- piecewise linearity. You can approximate very complicated nonlinear dynamics with piecewise linear ones if it is useful to do so

# Control
Funnels

# Dynamics verification and program verification
There are deep analogies between programs and dynamical systems.

Invariants

Lyapunov functins and termination functions

Weakest precondition / strongest precondition

Abstract interpretation
