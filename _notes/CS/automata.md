Myhill Nerode theorem

Automata minimization - Partition refinement
Separate into separate sets those which are definitely distinguishable (the remaining in same partition may or may not be). Things that transition into distinguishable things are distinguishable from each other

Datalog partition refinement?
Sets. Things definitely not in set.

DAWG - transitions are single labelled edges. Transitions are
