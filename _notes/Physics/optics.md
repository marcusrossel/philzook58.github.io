# Optics
## Geometrical Optics
### Etendue
### Pinhole Cameras
See projective geometry
### Thin Lens
### Snell's law
### Thick Lens
### Microscopes
### Telescopes

## Physical Optics
### Etendue 2
Numericsl Aperture
### Wavevector
Wavevectors match across boundaries. This is more geoemtry than physics or differential equations
Moire Patterns
### Diffraction
Single and Double
Near Field
Fraunhofer
Analogies with Quantum Mechanics
### Interference
Fourier Optics
