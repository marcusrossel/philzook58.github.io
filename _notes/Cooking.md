I feel like my internal model if what matters and doesn't for cooking is way off.
Some things seem like a waste of time joo joo and i just want to ignore them.

You want to brown stuff. You want the pan hotter than I'd think
I probably stir too often, not allowing crispiness.

Roasting spices? In oil?

I swear curries/chilis are more flavorful after being in the fridge for some time. Why?

Eggs, lower heat. Lots of stirring/whipping. Parmesan

Bacon, cream, and butter are really good.

I think Connie is right. Contact with the baking sheet helps baked veggies.

Knife skills. How much does evenness/size of chops help? I'm still kind of skeptical of this one
