## Pfaffian orientation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfaffian_orientation
A directon to each edge such that each cycle

Kastelyn orietnation

[FKT algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FKT_algorithm) for counting perfect matchings. Katelyn Temperley Fisher. Dimers.
pfaffian of skew symmettric matrix can be reduced to determinant
counting is useful in stat phys. entropy.

## perfect matchings
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_matching
pick edges such that exactly one edge touches every vertex

Related to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_cover where each vertex must touch at least one edge


## Minors
 tree decompoaitions

Algebraic Graph theory
Graph expanders

## Hamiltonian cycles
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path>
Visit each vertex once.
Travellign salesman problem is weighted relative

## Isomorphism
nauty
graph canonicalization. Find a way to sort vertices? If they all had unique attributes, sweet.
Then number of neighbors, other little facts. properties of neigbors
Could use properties of nehigbors
Could use labelling of neighbors too. That becomes a self consistent search. However, if you already know certain orderings (based on properties). Or you could branch
I'm not sure I'm understanding this the same way nauty does.


Graph hashing

disjoint set partition data structure?

## subgraph isomorphgism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_isomorphism_problem

## Graph rewriting
See term rewriting

double pushout.
A pattern L.
the "kept" bits K
the right hand side R, glued in

My temptation would be to: find a pattern L (using datalog/sql probably), store result in an env dict, blow it all away, paste in R filling in from the env.

The "env" can be represented as a graph homomorphism though from the pattern (a dictionary mapping vertices to vertices and edges to edges).
