# Statistics
I should have more to say here?
Probability
Experimental design
Hypothesis testing
Goodness of fit metrices
Bayes rules
Regularization
Bayes rule and regularization can be seen to be related. Regularization corresponds to a prior that the values of your parameters aren't going to be ridiculous. A Gaussian prior and guassian distrubtion of error

$$ e^{ -\frac{\eps^2}{\sigma^2} } $$
$$ y_j = \eps_j +  \sum a_i f_i(x_j) $$
