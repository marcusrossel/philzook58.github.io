[Abstract Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra)

# Elementary

An informal term, but you know. High school stuff and less.
Quadratic Equation
Manipulating both sides

# Monoids

# Groups

I don't know why, but this is still the one that makes me the most comfortable

- Representatations
- Permutations
- Symettries
- Lie Groups

GAP Magma

# Semirings

# Rings

- See nonlinear algebra

## Modules

# Fields

[finite fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field)/galois field. It's kind of remarkable finite fields even exist. A well behaving notion of number that includes division but is nevertheless finite

At a certain point of sophistication, this becomes all you care about it seems.
Exactness
