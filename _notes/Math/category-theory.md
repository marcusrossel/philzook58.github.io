Asbtract Finite categories
Kind of like a graph data structure. 
Kind of like a finite group.
A list of objects, a list of morphisms with domain and codomain, and a multiplication table.
Any particular question can be answered via enumeration

Finitely Generated Categories

# Axioms
Category is objects and morphisms. Morphisms have an operation called composition and there is an identity element

Functors are mappings between categories (a object to object map and morphism to morphism map) that plays nice with composition and identity. F(id) = id. F(f.g) = F(f) . F(g)



# Encodings
Relational Composition
comp(F,G,H)

Comp as Partial function
comp(F,G) = Some(H)

Objects as Sort

# Diagram Chasing


# Monoidal Categories
Vect



# String Diagrams


# Topos
