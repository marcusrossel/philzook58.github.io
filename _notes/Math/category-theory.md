Kind of like a finite group.
A list of objects, a list of morphisms with domain and codomain, and a multiplication table.
Any particular question can be answered via enumeration

Finitely Generated Categories


# Encodings
Relational Composition
comp(F,G,H)

Comp as Partial function
comp(F,G) = Some(H)

Objects as Sort

# Diagram Chasing


# Monoidal Categories
Vect



# String Diagrams


# Topos
