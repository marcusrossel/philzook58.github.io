Is there anything to even say about calculus?
Probably!

Calculus vs Analysis. Basically the same thing
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus>

# Calc I

Stewart Book

# Derivatives

Tangents and Secants

When do derivatives exists
Continuity
Moduli of continuity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity>

Product Rule
Chain Rule

Sequences
Series
Convergence Tests

Mean Value Theorem

Taylor Series

Infinitesimals

# Integrals

# Multivariate

# Partial Derivatives

Somewhat subtle actually. What does it mean to "fix" the other coordinates?

# Vector Calc

Grad Div Curl are best understood via their definition as

Line integrals

Stokes theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem>

# Exterior Calculus

See also differential geometry

# Calculus of Variations

Functional Derivative
Path Integral

# Analysis

Some book reccomendations:

Abbott understanding analysis
Spivak Calculus
Tao I and II
Rudin

open-closed induction. Very interesting.

[Soft analysis, hard analysis, and the finite convergence principle](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/05/23/soft-analysis-hard-analysis-and-the-finite-convergence-principle/) As cody says, competeness is infinite pigeonhole

[Cauchy sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence) sequences gets closer to itself rather than talking about limit value

Dirichlet cuts. Construct reals as sets of rationals.
The cut property.

Compactness is important here? Huh.
