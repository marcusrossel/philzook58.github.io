Is there anything to even say about calculus?
Probably!

Calculu vs Analysis. Basically the same thing

# Calc I
Stewart Book

# Derivatives
Tangents and Secants


When do derivatives exists
Continuity
Moduli of continuity
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity

Product Rule
Chain Rule


Sequences
Series
Convergence Tests

Mean Value Theorem




Taylor Series



Infinitesimals

# Integrals 


# Multivariate

# Partial Derivatives
Somewhat subtle actually. What does it mean to "fix" the other coordinates?

# Vector Calc

Grad Div Curl are best understood via their definition as 


Line integrals

Stokes theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem

# Exterior Calculus

See also differential geometry

# Calculus of Variations

Functional Derivative
Path Integral


# Analysis
Some book reccomendations:

Abbott understanding analysis
Spivak Calculus
Tao I and II
Rudin
Jay Cummings

# Limits
