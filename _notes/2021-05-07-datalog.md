Datalog


Dedalus datalog. Is it datalog with a time variable or something more? I think it may have changed the stratification conditions.

Z3 datalog has intervals? How do i find a list of supported domains
So I could use C-cube datalog
Or I could use Z3 datalog.
If I want to go in browser (and of course I do), then Z3 is not wise.
Neither is souffle.
Could roll own bad datalog.

could I compile datalog to bap?
class(slot,slot,slot) :- class(slot,slot,slot),
class(slotname : f(x,y) , ) :-
==
request body
promise head,

build rule.

differences
- classes have named columns, not positional (extensible). They also have unique ids always. Kind of more similar to souffle records?
- Modedness. Can I even promise multiple slots at once? In a sense datalog is not interestingly moded.
- It's more of a tabled prolog. Top down requests which lazily trigger table instantation

val promise : ('a, 'p) slot -> ('a obj -> 'p t) -> unit
('a, 'p) slot -> 'a obj -> 'p t

program(obj@{ insn : q , semantics : s }) :-   
program( obj: o, semantics : s, ) :-

Program.cls
promise slot1 (fun obj -> 

)

Hmm obj is incoming. slots are possibly incoming or outgoing

provides <-trigger(slot, obj), collects
    (slot : slotexpr :- obj)    -- the api of promise has obj incoming and slot outgoing
    Things don't _have_ to be built off of obj, but it sure helps.

An option domain is closest to ordinary datalog / tabled prolog


we can only promise on one slot. We can provide them all though. Individual slots are joined.
a list of lattice tuples vs lattice with projections

so datalog gives uniqueness of an entry easily
path(x,z) :- edge(x,y), path(y,z).
path(x,y) :- edge(x,y)
edge(1,2)
edge(2,3)

vertex(1).
vertex(2).
path(1,_).
path(2,_).
path(3,_).

path(a, _) :- vertex(a). -- trigger on path? but path doesn't exist


p@path( head_slot , tail_slot ) :- 



datalog over intervals. Maybe this would be an interesting blog post.
The relation itself has to implement the lattice api. Not the individual fields
What makes semi naive evaluation possible is the difference operator (heyting?)
Datalog does require a notion of projection. And a notion of relation composition/database join
E' = proj( A /\ B /\  C /\ D )
E1 = E \/ E'


Sometimes I've had knowledge base objects for which I immediately fill a slot upon creation, because that slot is essentially part of the objects identity. As an example, I have path objects in the KB. The only time i make one is when I have a particular path to talk about and I'm never going to offer another opinion about what that path is, all other information is derived from it. It feels slightly awkward that I have to define this slot using an optional domain, basically as far as I can tell, because I have to create an empty object and then provide for the slot on the next line. So I'm only using the `None` case for the briefest moment, but now have to deal with that case or use `Option.value_exn` whenever I access it. Is there a more elegant way to deal with nonoptional slots? I could use the `flat` domain with `[]` as a default but that is conflating

hmm. temporally oblivious. Interesting.
This idea of using explicit time is interesting. Why didn't I consider using an epoch variable?

Synactic sites. also interesting. Syntax is intrinisically finite.

Interpeting programs into datalog?


Context sensitivty. I kind of imagine copies of the CFG coming out of the plane of the screen. Finite loop unrolling and then just regular widening. A mapping from block to visitation # might work for example. Many combos might not exist. This probably won't get you much


What would be a simple functional language to do this on?

building souffle.
We revmoed all the extra flags turned off tests
removed all mentions of libffi
src/CMakeLists.txt - removed werror
CMakeLists.txt

removed ffi.h from interpeter/engine.cpp by removing the entire case

ok the frontend needs a bunch of stuff. It calls mcpp first.
This strips comments maybe?

https://github.com/hoodmane/libffi-emscripten
https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/11066
It's conceviable libffi could be made to work

I could probably easily enough manually remove any stratification restrictions.

Why can I not use the souffle implementation of ADT?
There is a cool directory of examples. There is a rewriting example in there

Datalog might be a good DSL for specifying egraph computation problems. It allows multipatterns. 
A special relation = for egraph equality. We disallow unification?
Stratified negation can be allowed in egraph pattern matching.
The egraph is a database.

pat1(A,B,C) :- 

Can't we use unification variables as eclasses?

We can't generate new eclasses though.

equiv(X,Y) :- lhspat, rhs(X)
rhschunk(Fresh, ) :- lhspat
rhschunk(Fresh, ) : lhspat

The de moura bjorner matcher is some kind of brother of the WAM.


This might enable integrating congurence closure with program analysis passes.


Datalog is a specification language of relations. It is similar in some respects to SQL.

A relation is a set of tuples. One method for storing it is to use an array of tuples.

A slightly expanded form of datalog we could require that every variable is unique unless using a special `=` clause. 
It has a simple precodural reading

However, this naive storage method and algorithm is not the most efficient. Ideally, you want to use some pieces of the tuples as indices and use fast data structures for them (hashmaps or search trees). There is also much redundant computation here.
We want to push from small relations into larger ones and use indexing to 

factored form:
ancestor() :-  parent() ; (), ()
Kind of like a function call now.
generators that return only unique elements
Hmm. That's kind of a curious thing. It's push memoization rather than pull memoization.

def ancestor():
    seen = set()

    if newtup not in seen:
        yield newtup

Top down + Memoization

function parent()
    return [(:greg, :larry)]
end

function ancestor(x,y,z)
    for (x,z) parent()
end

a relation lifter.

Or could use explicit fix? memofix 
function rel(f, args...) 
    ctx = Dict()
    for arg in args
        if arg isa Symbol

    end
end

We really want to extend previous definitions not override them

Stream memoization.
How can I get the other modes for free? If you implement the fully producing mode, receiving mode is easy.
But unduly expensive.
How do you solve mode constraints.
Asymptotic costs. log_n( n^5 * ) 


https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~warren/xsbbook/node5.html assign once variables.
@prolog x = y 

if inscope(x)
if inscope(y)
You could catch the undefvarerror? maybe.

I guess we could macro the entire function and change the semantics of =.
@nondet block for multiple function defintiions

I guess we could return unique IDs along the channels too
Using mutiple dispatch
f(::X, ::Y)
f()

@nondet()
f(x) = 
f(x) = 
end
rewrites to
f(x)
    [def1, def2]
end

How do we encode the mutliples:
1. array
2. channel
3. coroutine?
3. iterator

Hmmm. I could use tabled swipl instead of souffle.
