@arntzenius Sorry, twitter char limits makes me be terse. As Kris said, equality of uninterpreted functions ~ egraphs. Since you only have a finite number of terms to consider, you can bit blast the eq relation with trans, refl, sym axioms. That‚Äôs ackermanization. Sometimes it‚Äôs great.

@joe_hellerstein @arntzenius More pragmatically, if the number of possible proof trees is finite but huge, the encoding of one sat variable per possible proof tree isn't a good encoding. So does ASP give us some power to encode proof trees better? Maybe. Not sure.

@joe_hellerstein @arntzenius On the first point, I think if there isn't a decision procedure to know if there is a proof tree or not, it is a philosophical position to say existence or non-existence are the only possibilities. This wades into rejection of the law of excluded middle.

@arntzenius I am pretty confused on the relationship between ASP and deduction. It vaguely feels somewhere in between. There is some kind of 2-world kripke model, so that kind of jives. (Here and there logic / equilibrium logic I think?) SAT has 1 world, Intuitionistic has many worlds.

@arntzenius My understanding is that ASP can use SAT (assat) and clingo's solver is SAT-like, but with the caveat you need to put in (possibly many) loop breaking formulas. It's subjective, but this is isn't sufficient for me to want to equate them. Ackermannized EUF -&gt; SAT doesn't conflate

@2over124 Not naive. A very interesting question. SMT techniques push SAT (strong ground branchy search) to handle quantifiers incompletely. This treats "forall" well and completely but probably weak for SAT-like problems. I don't know that these systems are compared toe to toe often.

@codydroux It's all a bit silly, because the warnings do detect some kind of issue, and I shouldn't and probably wouldn't write this in most situations. But I think this an educational microcosm for me.

@codydroux UBSan adds instrumentation. It should be possible to check with extra runtime metadata. It may not support that particular kind of check or I may have to dig into options. Or maybe the code was fine from some lawyering perspective. It is difficult for me to know as a neophyte.

@codydroux ok yes. "Types are partitioned into object types (types that describe objects) and function types (types that describe functions)." That does sound conclusive.

@notjfmc @2over124 I think going to C is important. Leveraging CBMC / SV Comp is huge. These are very good solvers. LLVM -&gt; C is it's own can of worms and few if any are trying to maintain connection back to the assembly rather than a clean source like output.

@notjfmc Ghidra also offers an interactive diassembling environment and is aimed at reversing.  Both support many ISAs. Pcode spec is small, llvm ir is quite large and has more confusing semantics. Perhaps @2over124 could comment.

@notjfmc I don't have, nor does ghidra have microarchitectural semantics to my knowledge. I haven't used mctoll but I'll take a look. They seem similar in spirit, obviously there is more work done there. LLVM is a tough bronco to ride. Perhaps Alive2 + mctoll could do something similar.

@codydroux I think there is a design space here. You can have trusted abstract type, a central authority that remembers all proven theorems that you can request by name, this hashy style, or legit proof trees that can be checked later

@codydroux There is merkle tree style. I think that would require proof objects. But mimicking simple lcf style doesn‚Äôt have proof objects. The process that you had to interface with a controlled api is the proof.

@codydroux Sure. Anyone can call Obj.magic also. You get more protection if you hide your kernel behind an api endpoint. Its more about protecting me from myself than an antagonistic enemy. That‚Äôs a tough design

@codydroux I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been using it a lot. Translation is a rote task. It did help me a lot but at the same time doing it manually is useful for getting my brain in the groove. It also doesn‚Äôt feel like my coding style, but how could it have guessed?

@mwillsey @JulesJacobs5 @yihongz_bot CHR has multiset semantics and destructive use of facts. Both of these are core features and not exotic extensions of chr. Destroying facts requires more restrictive operational semantics unless you know your rules are confluent. There is a lot of overlap though.

@pkhuong I think ‚ÄúSelect distinct‚Äù is doing some preliminary deduping under the hood. The delta = new - old step seems unavoidable and bad anyway. Sqlite afaik is serial. I‚Äôm a fan of chasing fast simple serial rather than parallel usually. Stay flexible.

@pkhuong This sounds similar to my previous standard encoding of seminaive using a new, delta, and old table per relation. Flip flopping all these tables was a lot (20 lines maybe) of boiler plate machinery that I‚Äôm pleased the new rowid timestamp encoding removes.

@Asmodehn Yes, that is reasonable. I think datalog‚Äôs purity + simplicity make it relatively easy to implement this feature. Timestamps do enable backjumping by filtering on timestamp. You could timestamp all data produced in a pure functional lang too.

@krismicinski I‚Äôm not sure I follow. Mechanically recording timestamps and post processing is easy. You are referring to allowing relations to inspect timestamps inside the datalog program itself? That‚Äôs not obviously a problem to me using a min lattice.

Datalog timestamps are a form of lightweight provenance because backwards proof search (prolog) can follow them to be non backtracking and terminating/well founded, vastly simplifying proof reconstruction

@kmett @u_map_prop @ejpatters @mwillsey @lindsey I have been in the habit as thinking of datalog as the framework to fit other things into. Propagators are the framework for you? I'm confused where I'm confused, but I am probably confused. A problem(?): the language of datalog speaks of rows/elements, not the database itself.

@krismicinski The very word decompilation and the conception of the problem as being in relation to compilation are at the origin of it. It‚Äôs a mind box that is hard to see you‚Äôre even in. That the tools of compilation are appropriate and useful is a hypothesis, not a foregone conclusion.

My current pitch is that decompilation could be (should be?) defined as dis-macro-assembly. C syntax shellac on macro assembler semantics. Correctness is then defined as does the macro assembler produce the right assembly code when run. Devil in details. <https://t.co/qaGRCXYjNX>

@mgrnbrg @krismicinski I think one would indeed try to represent the known not  facts rather than starting from a full database. One can model via dualizing I think, but it's tricky. When I'm hand coding this, I'm human compiling a simple spec to something awful, which is evidence of a new language.

@mgrnbrg @krismicinski Assorted thoughts: Instead of adding facts to iteratively to empty DB, iteratively remove facts that can't possibly be derived from DB starting from full Herbrand universe? Good for encoding automata algorithms? Run rule "backwards" (head to body), but still bottom up.

Another example of using the justification principle for a Z3 encoding of a first class union find. Roots match _only_ if they can be justified by a path (implicit spanning tree). Without this justification restriction, Z3 is free to overapproximate by collapsing all roots to one <https://t.co/QgXWbK6pPe>

Another interesting "proof relevant" embedding of datalog into Z3. Somehow the fixed point of ADTs enables describing the fixed point of datalog. Forward inference is normal, backwards every derivation is justified in a well founded way via a proof term ADT. <https://t.co/itZG6k9SXf>

An interesting, but bad encoding. You can use Z3 optimization <https://t.co/CgLPLQBuEm> to encode datalog as producing the minimal model. Z3 ships with a datalog <https://t.co/ae5I8vO1r7>, so this is insane for most purposes. <https://t.co/OwNlp7mL8K>

@krismicinski @2over124 The idea is that you can emulate an imperative program in prolog by passing state. In principle a perfect CHC solver takes care of all chaining of control flow of individual instructions and infers loop invariants. Prolog itself is a kind of depth first solver of CHCs

@krismicinski I also did something similar with bap. It isn‚Äôt quite clear to me why someone would want a raw single insn-&gt;smt transition relation tool. If this use case was clear, I think almost every binary lifting system could supply a fairly push button method. <https://t.co/O6k2XOVB3Y>

@krismicinski The question is a little vague. Assembly  is imperative. SMT is a logic. What does lifting to SMT mean? Instruction to transition relation? Predicate transformer? Symbolic execution of paths? There are pushbutton symbolic execution engines driven by smt.

@2over124 Very good points. My current thinking is that many of the things that feel like ‚Äúwidening‚Äù are actually working over a coarser or more subtle ordinary lattice ( like having 7 jump to inf or keeping track of loop visitation number).Exposing datalog iter # to widen feels wrong.

@kmett @xtimv @NWF Thanks! I really appreciate that coming from you! I‚Äôve been pushing towards ~ this goal. The more attackable starting point imo is ‚Äúwhat is lambda datalog‚Äù. <https://t.co/UbV0SNWFTg>  <https://t.co/tGTOPhk1Gr>  I‚Äôve never used an LF besides poking at the twelf tutorial. Which one?

@xtimv Prolog is beautiful. I‚Äôd love to take a look. Tabling is pretty complicated. Rather strange control flow. Somewhere in the mental arena of coroutines and continuations

@burakemir I am not convinced. This is a perspective that can change. Tabling is so clearly related to datalog. Datalog can be naturally extended in wildly expressive directions (often at some cost or another).  More comparing and contrasting here <https://t.co/UbV0SNWFTg>

@xtimv Because datalog is so much simpler I suspect it is easier find the system programmers to build a blazingly fast implementation.

@xtimv <https://t.co/5jpk2U1NXT> subsumptive tabling beats magic set which I embarrassingly quoted as the opposite conclusion in a convo at pldi. I honestly don‚Äôt believe it. My prior that pragmatically datalog is more performant is high. This opinion is based on no evidence whatsoever.

@2over124 Tabled prolog significantly improves the termination problem. If you write a program in the datalog fragment, tabling will make it terminating. Tabling does typically still define a meaning to clause ordering that datalog typically doesn‚Äôt.

@pkhuong Very reasonable. Small is good. I think the strength of datalog is that it is simple more than almost anything else.  It is strangely difficult to justify simple as novel.

It‚Äôs odd that datalog is ‚Äúpopular‚Äù and tabled prolog is less so. Are the reasons random, social or technical?

@TaliaRinger There is a question of ‚Äúexpress‚Äù vs actually solves. The SMT procedure with quantifiers is dicy and typically incomplete. It intrinsically understands its theories (like int) in a semantic way, not a syntactic way, so I‚Äôm not sure it is really a logic in a strict sense.

@TaliaRinger My ultra naive explanation: equality is for rewriting. To specify rewriting you need to supply 1. The equality  proof 2. The thing to rewrite 3. Where inside the thing you want to rewrite (the dependent return type). These are the main arguments to the recursor. Agda infers 3.

@codydroux <https://t.co/MMfxak0RFl> <https://t.co/CYgP8AcTfS> <https://t.co/yKpAaooLmg> Both are similar feeling classes of formulas in first order logic that are guaranteed to terminate under simple inference schemes. Both arguments seem to rely on that you don't generate new symbols really.

The closest syntactic analog to the typing judgement `a : A, b : B, c : C |- f : F` in Coq is `Definition foo (a : A) (b : B) (c : C) : F := f.` The `f` and `F` are swapped and the symbols are wrong. It is always shocking how much symbols can throw me. Magnetic Field is B.

@codydroux Well that is the start of why they are more fun. You get a infinite supply of non interchangable pointer types, which can be useful for preventing giving back that wrong one. And I suppose they are castable to each other in a certain sense across type signature boundaries

@bgavran3 @fairbanksjp @ChadScherrer @ejpatters @0x0f0f0f1 A standard answer is that resource awareness has something to do with linear types, which in turn has something to do with monoidal categories that are not cartesian. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I thought this might be what @kmett be alluding to here? <https://t.co/jQcXZTLMg0>

@Iceland_jack @haskell_cat The similarity of this to ST has made me wonder if there is something cogent to be said about equality types and mutation. I remember a Kiselyov post that looked something like the below (it was about GADT-less equality), but I can't find it anymore <https://t.co/8jyqVKtpr1>

@bgavran3 @ChadScherrer @fairbanksjp @ejpatters @0x0f0f0f1 I've been on a possibly quixotian quest to do automatic reasoning for categories. Egraphs are a promising data structure for that purpose. They encode equality information over ground terms efficiently.

@ChadScherrer @bgavran3 @fairbanksjp @ejpatters @0x0f0f0f1 An interesting observation in the egraph based stuff is that the egraph can store all and extract particular good associations. This is a point in its favor against a canonicalizing flattening approach, which is a typical way of treating associativity and commutativity.

Artists intimately encounter the difference between syntax and semantics. Color, shape, lines are syntax and dog or house or door is semantics. The biggest trick to drawing is forgetting the semantics exists and just seeing what you see.

@notjfmc Egg itself is of no relation to CHR certainly, and I suspect you'd need an incremental egraph implementation to integrate with a more traditional prolog execution. The closer analog of egg/egglog is actually datalog with an odd backing table implementation

@codydroux @ciphernyx This is a good point. But the exact opposite angle is interesting too. We can start from known digital circuit verification techniques. The cfg is somewhere between the two. Another interesting starting point is supposing you give a manual predicate for every edge.

@AriKatz20 @TaliaRinger @0x0f0f0f1 Attack style 1: use combinators instead of binding forms. Category theory inspired perhaps. Attack style 2: de bruijn indices or levels. Play nice with hash consing. Raising and lowering them is not simple in an egraph though. Attack 3: gensym bound vars. Manual alpha recovery

@AriKatz20 @TaliaRinger @0x0f0f0f1 Well, my first inclination has been to wonder how to deal with alpha equivalence. It is not obvious. I have had a couple prongs of attack, but none entirely satisfactory. I am guessing that cubical type theory will require at least this much.

@AnneOgborn @fairbanksjp Yea, these examples wouldn't fit "well moded" whatever I meant by that? The first might be ok. C output pointer args might allow you to mimic in a way a vanilla det prolog clause with all ++ and  - mode variables, if I understand the conventions correctly <https://t.co/FYTA7dYILO>

@m_misamore On the flipside, C doesn't even have other modes by default. So those are both expensive to write and then equally expensive to test if actually needed.

@AnneOgborn @fairbanksjp My naive model of prolog unification is that of pointer manipulation in a union find structure and it does in some sense return by setting an "output" pointer to some tree structure. Clearly C doesn't have backtracking, full unification, or truly reversible args built in

@AnneOgborn @fairbanksjp I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar with the terminology, but curious. This is not referring to attributed variables is it? Model may be a strong word for the observation. I'm noting that there is a mainstream notion of arguments being outputs.

@fairbanksjp Sure. The funny nonintuitive thing is that pointer passing C and prolog use the last syntax even when they mean the former syntaxes. There is wisdom to be gained by directionalizing undirected relations, see for example bidirectional type systems or picking indices for DBs

In hindsight obvious: the relational flavor of well moded prolog is quite similar to the C style where you pass in output pointers and return void.

@KenoFischer @codydroux That's interesting. I'm somewhat surprised that the Julia compiler needs to prove termination. I don't think non-verifying compilers usually do? I think of the Dafny interface as the gold star in terms of what a Julia programmer might like.

@SMT_Solvers So a theorem prover for type isomorphisms? No one has done this here yet. It should be the same laws as ordinary exponentials, products and sums. Where it gets interesting is quantifiers, and perhaps where the connection to coend calculus discussed at the end of the post comes in

@tangled_zans Having said that, I have more fondness for Haskell than any other language. And I barely use it these days. And somehow I only have medium fondness for Julia despite using it a decent amount. Is there a correlation here?

@tangled_zans It is attractive because it doesn't look odd to scientists and engineers, doesn't hammer the functional paradigm, isn't awful to use like lower level languages and in principle has llvm speeds for native Julia written numerical code with a little massaging.

@tangled_zans Well, Julia and Haskell have their own wonderful flavors. I'd say maybe a good start would be to say Julia is analytic and Haskell is algebraic (yes, yes. I know. I know. It's a good first pass statement). I don't know that anyone is working on that in particular.

@codydroux Both should be controversial. R3 is not a good model of physical space in all possible regimes of size. Probably the concept of using R to model physical things and the very concept of space break down although no one really knows to what.

@SMT_Solvers I do see a utility to something more toolbox-y that interprets from llvm to z3. Clearly the guts of KLEE and other tools do it, but I'm not sure how exposed it is and I'm not much of a C++ dude. This (defunct?) project sounds compelling for example <https://t.co/PAtXIR6LwJ>

@vinodg Agda is dependent pattern matching based focused, cubical agda, haskell flavored syntax. Lean to my eye looks more closer to coq than agda. I've heard that it doesn't shy from classical reasoning and there's occasional hullaballoo about quotient types in lean vs setoid reasoning

@vinodg I'm not aware of any canonical comparison.
I believe their foundations are the same modulo details.
Coq has tactics, tends to separate program and proof, more mature projects for verification of external programs, compcert, ocaml flavored syntax.

@lemmster @hillelogram It's a good read. My opinion atm is that types help the automation and are worth it solely on that merit, similar to how types help compilers know how to optimize your code rather than a pile of bits. For pure thought purposes I could be convinced either way.

@dillontkearns @hillelogram @elmlang That is an intriguing suggestion. Most commits do intend to change behavior, so that might lead to a lot of false negatives and tendency to ignore the results. We have the capability to express more flexible relationships than equivalence but need some user input.

@bgavran3 Right. Going from 2 to 1 is applying something to id:dx -&gt; dx. Going from 1 to 2 is using \ f -&gt; f . (g :: dy -&gt; dx) :: forall s. (dx -&gt; s) -&gt; (dy -&gt; s) somewhere in the interior of that lens expression

~&gt; forall s. (x , dx -&gt; s) -&gt; (y , dy -&gt; s)

What this is evocative of is that reverse mode AD is a map pulling back linear functionals (dx -&gt; R). Analog of dual number formulation (x,dx) of forward mode AD.

@valeriadepaiva Well, CPS is notoriously bizarrely useful for program transformations and partial evaluation (Appel's book for example). It also isn't so crazy to explain as a way of making control flow exhibit. So I'd like a down to earth thing like that. Something to do with mutation?

@musa314 @Iceland_jack This is an interesting question. The abstraction cost of relations appears to be much higher. Functions are relatively simple to convert to assembly. You'd need a much smarter compiler to get off the ground, and could perhaps easily get non-determinism leaks.

@_julesh_ @davidad Sounds like a difficult question. You could write a checker function that sees if an automatically differentiable function obeys the equations at a particular point. At least that denotes the system, although not very usefully. Or it could return residuals instead of a bool.

@ejpatters This is an interesting question that I‚Äôve been pursuing for a bit. I have a strong suspicion that I can implement polyhedral relations (or polyhedral cones) using readily available cdd and lrs packages. General cones is less clear. I suspect ADMM would be a useful component.

@philipthrift Do turing machines exist? They rely on infinite tapes. But no system has infinite tape. Not my laptop. But no system is so perfectly isolated as to make perfect boundaries. It‚Äôs all a matter of perspective and modelling. I tend to go finite and discrete.

@_sofia_af @_julesh_ I guess in my head I was thinking about functions on a finite set with the discrete topology where all the sets are open. And then combining functions defined on different chunks such that they agree on the overlap, which might be expressible in liquid haskell. Not sure.

@_sofia_af @_julesh_ I‚Äôm talking at a way simpler level. I don‚Äôt know much about domain theory. I meant domain as in the set a function comes from like the integers 3 through 7, which is something you could specify in liquid haskell.

@_sofia_af @_julesh_ That‚Äôs an interesting idea. A more straightforward thing might be to glue functions with domain constrained by liquid haskell? It feels like more of the direct analog of the simplest examples of sheaves.

Hot take: might be nice if regular function abstraction and application syntax meant the finally tagless embedding and use something more verbose when you actually want regular functions. Finally tagless seems nutso powerful

@_julesh_ Another related notion to chew on is pseudoinvertible functions, functions without unique inverses. Derivatives give you a linear approximation to pseudo inversion, but why not pack the full thing into the lens? It also gets much closer to actually obeying the laws.

@bgavran3 I‚Äôve been wondering about how to describe convex optimization problems categorically and not found much out there. Couple of thoughts: Convexity is almost compositional. How to fix that? ADMM is a technique to combine black box convex optimization problems. Could be a useful.

@luqui @FunctorFact @AnalysisFact My best guess is category 1 has ordinary smooth functions like sine and stuff as morphisms and category 2 has jacobian matrices as morphisms with composition given by the matrix product. I‚Äôm not sure that is right. Points in R^n, don‚Äôt map to tangent vectors really.

If a can be unified to any c, it is universal.

@alex_berg Well, I guess the forall being over a f :: *-&gt;*  kinded object. The main place that shows up (that I know of) is in lens. And it somehow implies that it only contains id, just like the lens case implies it holds setters and getters. Trying to figure that out now.
