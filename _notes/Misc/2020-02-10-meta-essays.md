The power of magic words
Reverse citations
Dig down to a highly cited paper and dig up
Look at common authors

# How to understand
Read many things shallowly. 5 books at once. Keeps it fresh. You'll notice the important commonalities
Keep a textfile open
Write an explanation on your blog and get precious doots
Break down, concretify and simplify to a ridiculous extent
What homework would you assign? Do it. Understanding is in the hands.

active learning
- copy out. rote learning is good
- gotta load stuff up to the brain
- 

#### code base splelunking
- Build it. Try verbose mode. Try to kind of pay attention to the stream of things flying by
- Run it. Run the examples
- Look at tests
- Look at build files. They may implicitly provide a hierarchy
- Look top down or bottom up. If there is an output, something prints it. There is probably a main


- Try trivial modifications. Adding a case to some data type for example.

It's hard to pick links. Some of REALLY good, but it's hard to denote that. This is why link dumps aren't that useful. Lack of emphasis.

Ctrl+Shift+V puts in markdown render mode.
"markdown shortcuts" auto generates table of contents
Go into .vscode/jeepshen... /src/share.js to add new languages. Not ideal
Also executorMap in package.json. I re aliased python to python3

Maybe what I want is shebangs  `#! c++ /tmp/foo -o /tmp/a.out && /tmp/a.out`? Sometimes I want to add command line flags. Then I could use whatever highlighting I want. It would be better to have a hotkey to do this.

```python
print("hello world")
```
```ocaml
let () = print_endline "hello world"
```
```julia
print("hi")
```
```bash
echo hellow
```
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    puts("foo");
}
```
```souffle
.decl foo(x : number)
foo(3).
.output foo(IO=stdout)
```

```

npm install â€“g vsce
vsce package
```

It's to abuse your host languages features.
To avoid deeply embedding DSLs

Should I be using formal methods?

If no one in your industry uses it, and you find it uninteresting, don't do it. Life is too short.
If people in your industry are interested, and you've actually investigated it and think it will make your life hell, fight it tooth and nail.


People who work in the field want you to think so. It is in their best interested in terms of prestige,
Just because they use big fancy words and opine about the philosophical beauty 
Just because it is in their best interest does not mean they are wrong.
