# Oct 15 Carrigain

A nice tight trip with Ben, Bonby, Ali and Fern.

Kind of weird hotel situation.
Woke up early got breaky at wagon wheel and saw the most amazing dawn as we drove through crawford's nothc.
Extremely nice day.

Super bushed afterwards, I zonked out in the car. Kind of hurt my knee on the last mile or so.
