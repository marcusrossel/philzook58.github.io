The mysterious prolog difference list [1,2,3,|A]-A is not really that different from a linked list that keeps a pointer to it's last node. One can easily see why that would have O(1) append. In some respects, unification variables are disciplined pointers. https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~warren/xsbbook/node5.html

A geometrical perspective: Union finds define equivalence classes via contraction maps. A point is equivalent to another if their fixed point is the same. Path compression accelerates the contraction while retaining the fixed points.

If you believe a program computes something, a trace of its execution is a proof object. Some proofs objects can be seen as a compression of this trace.
