this is my favorite intro to compilers for complete beginners btw -- it's like 11 page of straight dense bars, I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't know anything about compilers at all and just want a taste https://t.co/uFxLp4zPz4

@SandMouth As a side note, re: this part of the post,

"I’m not exactly sure the conditions under which clark completion alone is sufficient"

I believe the ASP literature calls these "tight" programs, and program tightness is checkable with some syntactic conditions.

SAT solving is about booleans.
Logic programming is about proofs.

SAT solving treats true/false symmetrically.
In logic programming, truth requires justification.

SAT solving makes choices.
Logic programming makes deductions.

@PrologInfo I worked on a Prolog-&gt;JS compiler (with no interpreter) many years ago https://t.co/C0YZDQWFNc . Benchmarks still run but WASM approach (https://t.co/jm8G7AK2Nh) is better for large code, easier to maintain (same code base), and even faster in many benchmarks.

Back in college I wrote a toy "Prolog" implementation (unification + resolution, but no cut/effects/etc).

Looking back, the code is surprisingly short (if a bit dense). Pattern-matching + the list monad are really expressive for this sort of thing!

Gabbay, McBrien (1991) Temporal queries and historical databases. VLDB. Discusses how in the context of timestamped databases ("historical") various temporal operators are expressed using "Since" and "Until" and translated away. It is like a recipe for applying LTL to DBs.

The simply typed lambda calculus is to cartesian closed categories
as System F (STLC + parametric polymorphism) is to ____?

In other words, what are the semantics of parametric ∀/∃? Do they have something to do with ends/coends?

I literally just got it running, so there's a few improvements I want to make, but here's my port of Differential Dataflow running through 7 generations of a transitive closure circuit, each adding and removing edges.

This was probably the hardest thing I've ever gotten working? https://t.co/glzgeUxCpa

Aside, the playground link doesn’t really work on mobile (except for just reading the code) since it seems to override the normal zoom/scroll/clipboard/editing functions.

I was talking with a colleague last night about how I want to make certain verification tools (especially Liquid Haskell) better, and they asked why I didn't just use a different tool if it had those problems. So: why LH? 🧵

### [Tweet ID: 1557402354147766272](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1557402354147766272)
LH turns Haskell into a proof assistant, which is amazing! But it's not a very *good* proof assistant. It lacks the interactivity and tool support that mature proof assistants have. And of course it's just way less battle-tested and has more bugs, including soundness issues.

@SandMouth put differently: what if you think angr, bap, etc..'s symbolic executors suck (angr laughably slow for nontrivial code) and just want to lift the semantics for each instruction--how would you do it? Not sure, honestly. We are doing some of this now with Datalog in our group.

EGraph analysis feels like propagation but is so local. 

EAnalysis evaluates expressions in the abstract domain (1..2+2..3=3..5), and finds a fixpoint. Usually the domain has a galois connection so there is a unique best abstract interpretation for each expression

As far as I can tell nobody's typeset it, so I did-- hopefully now it's more accessible. I don't think reading it is necessary to understanding the other (published) work on LCF but it satisfied some curiosity for me regardless.

I'm intrigued by @rustlang getting better support for model checkers, theorem proving, and so forth. I would like it to be easy (but not required) to get stronger guarantees than Rust's type system provides. This post shows some of the potential. Cool stuff. https://t.co/27ikhsMIDQ

@ciphernyx @SMT_Solvers @touisteur @kmett I have a few gripes about certain papers in the literature which created the expectation one can make 8-10+ length superoptmization sequences (by doing things like "declaring all the instruction types in advance" and "having a fixed # of each"). In reality, even 4 is a bear.

@touisteur I think of ASP solvers as parallel evolution SAT solvers. They have a human-oriented input language, quantifiers and some arithmetic via an EPR-like instantiation. The propositional solver then had a "theory" of cardinality, weights and inductive definitions.

- Package manager

@TaliaRinger @LawrPaulson @jjcarett2 @andrejbauer There are two things (at least) that you can do about it:
1) turn algebra into arithmetic by reflecting operations as constructors of a syntax;
2) redesign definitional equality to do more algebra.
Lots of people are thinking about 1, including me. I am also thinking about 2.

@SandMouth Unrelated, but a while ago when I was working on https://t.co/7XPe9tWHVQ I wanted to figure out how to encode the classic dominators dataflow equations as datalog. Turns out you can't, because it involves recursion under negation, however... 1/2

@SandMouth ... the number of negations the recursion is under is _even_. I asked michael arntzenius about this and he mentioned that CodeQL has something called "parity-stratified negation", but I could never figure out how it was meant to work and there's no papers on it. 2/2

@SandMouth valgrind is a great tool for checking for memory leaks (on Linux). Use like "valgrind ./a.out" on your compiled executable, it prints a "LEAK SUMMARY" of bytes and blocks.  Handy for subtle things like non-virtual dtors, especially with "--leak-check=full" to get stack traces.

@luctielen @SandMouth i find it sad that i always wind up rolling my own AST code in c++ to make something both fast and memory dense, usually stealing bits off the pointer for the tag. You'd think _by now_ there'd be a good way to do this.

@SandMouth std::variant gets you something that doesn't piss away time jumping to unknown pointers to do case analysis, and is frankly the backbone of how to make good fast c++ code these days. shared_ptr gets you usable enough reference counting to start with until you decide you need gc.

@SandMouth Any of these will work! I'd say shared_ptr + variant gets you closest to how you'd prototype this in Rust or OCaml. unique_ptr and shared_ptr will both help avoid memory leaks (the latter in the absence of cycles), and then [0] can help confirm https://t.co/fx3SCvoJG0

@SandMouth Social factors:
* Datalog is significantly more theory friendly
* Prolog is negatively associated w/ "good old fashioned AI"
* Some corporations do analytics in Datalog (e.g., LogicBlox's clients). I don't think anything remotely like that for Prolog

@SandMouth Are we not saying the same here? I am not trying to perpetuate dogma, just saying the Prolog community's stance is that Prolog is about SLD resolution. IMHO you can use 100% of Prolog techniques in the ctx of datalog, yet datalog and Prolog remain different "foundations."

@SandMouth Bottom-up evaluation (aka forward chaining) is set at a time and therefore more memory hierarchy friendly than top-down (or backward chainring). It is also easier to parallelize. Datalog systems &amp; databases typically use the former and are usual faster and more scalable.

@xtimv @SandMouth @NWF FWIW- egglog is adorable. I keep trying to figure out what a LF equivalent to it would be, as I tend to use LFs like a typed prolog.

@SandMouth I think the renewed interest in datalog might have more to do with "provably small language, but usefully bigger than sql," more so than "prolog but better performance/termination guarantees."

Learning the modern definitions of double categories and their maps, where one direction is strict and the other is pseudo, has really helped me understand how the other 2-dimensional structures—2-categories, bicategories, and monoidal categories—fit together.

@SandMouth @davidcnorrismd The joke was a combination of: (1) applying the same suggestion somewhat analogously to the new name (2) hinting that I regard CLP and thus Prolog Modulo Theories as part of Prolog itself and (3) yielding an allusion to recursion which is characteristic for Prolog programs.

@u_map_prop @ejpatters @johncarlosbaez @tangled_zans The fact that Julia’s type system is for controlling multiple dispatch and not proving theorems lets it get out of our way. We can always write less informative types and check that the imperative implementation is correct with tests.

@ShriramKMurthi @nsiivola @khinsen Recency bias here though. The optional typing implementation in SBCL was written in the 1980s by Rob McLachlan at CMU. It's documented in "Design of CMU Common Lisp" https://t.co/qlZTl3xINN. So it is not that weird that research papers aren't being published about it lately.

@jonmsterling @EgbertRijke Related story: when I was a grad student, Dana Scott asked the class to compute ∩ { A × A → A | A ∈ PER(℘ω) }. It took me two days to prove it was just π₁ and π₂. I told him, and he just said “And what about Aⁿ → A?” I started to suspect he knew something I didn't.

IMHO: Don’t bother with the Teyjus implementation, but Elpi and Makam seem interesting. Makam has a nice recent functional pearl, while Elpi is something we use at work (through Coq-Elpi, but Elpi’s not dependent on Coq).

@wcrichton @pl_pierce @kamatsu8 @ShriramKMurthi If we manage to get local modes upstream for OCaml, you could even compare OCaml's approach and Rust's approach to stack allocation!  Though, probably focusing on OCaml for its functional core is easier...

PROTIP: You can simply modify the PT_PHDR program header of a dynamic ELF to a PT_LOAD and point it to some area with your code, change entry point, and leave the rest of the file as is. Then you can trigger bugs in dynamic/section parsing without interfering with the execution.

An interesting memory entanglement case is a concurrent hash table. If the elems-to-be-inserted are allocated dynamically during parallel insertions, then this entangles the insertions.

It's easy to disentangle it, by preallocating the elems-to-be-inserted.

However...

logic programming is constraint solving: an implication 'y :- x' is an inequality x ≤ y over booleans.

constraint solving is finding a least prefix point: minimize x while solving f(x) ≤ x.

(and least pfps are initial algebras, but I'm not sure what use that is yet)

Sets are of course very important for mathematics. But for computer science, I’m finding myself more and more convinced that the “bag” (multiset) is more useful as a fundamental concept.

(Disclaimer: just something on my mind recently... a bit wishy washy)

The square root can be uniformly approximated to error ε by a rational function of degree O(log²(1/ε)).

This surprising, since a polynomial approximation (e.g. Taylor series) requires degree Ω(1/ε), so rational functions are exponentially better than polynomials. https://t.co/l48sGPbhTb

@GabriellaG439 Later on I found https://t.co/ITgkYrSijP and https://t.co/PHhZvmqtS7 to be extremely useful! But yeah I'm not sure how easy they would be to get into from scratch. I often joke that it would be neat to have some sort of “Crafting Elaborators” book for getting people started.

comparing the C runtime to the Java runtime might be one of my favorite assistive analogies now

clang shells out to gcc to link on glibc platforms for the same fundamental reasons you can't just emit code for Hotspot to load and run, but no one expects the latter to be possible

a few people have raised this point, but consider: if the only practically usable syscall wrapper library for your platform for some historical reason requires linking in a JVM, is that a _reason_ to use JNI? or is it just the reason you suffer? https://t.co/M8otu6z1tn

corollary: the only reason to link to libc is to directly interface with programs that use the C runtime. it's like how you have to use JNI when talking to Java code https://t.co/dmTyVnoZk3

C (as typically deployed) has a runtime that will allocate and deallocate resources, track their lifetime, needs to wrap all user code, enforce synchronized access, and so on

it doesn't do that for the _heap_, but does for e.g. threads and TLS slots

That was the idea in my 1977 thesis: turning Prolog into the standard not only for querying data bases, but to represent them, update them, etc. Using logic throughout can even result in NL analysers that directly output queries (syntax) directly executable (semantics) by the DB. https://t.co/DzzT7lA7r5

Spent a fair amount of time over the last 2 days reading @andrasKovacs6 's PhD thesis (read chap. 1-4, skimmed after that). Very enjoyable. Fascinating too is that it "aims" at algebraic theories, and ends up having deep applications to meta-programming as a side-effect.

@SandMouth @sergeybratus Nicely done and great points about high/low.  We're dealing with an additional angle in that problem with Ghidra output which is source high, binary low, decompiler high :-D (!= to the first two). this is a nice explanation of the issues.

If I can offer an observation, 20+ years into my software career:

Long term, your kindness and helpfulness are vastly more impactful than your technical skills. 

People will remember how you made them feel. They're much less likely to remember that awesome function you wrote.

This came out of larger compiler fuzzing work with Alex Groce, Goutamkumar Kalburgi, and @clegoues https://t.co/SUem9CNigA

@SandMouth top down or bottom up? top down - 
- complete the language by adding nonterminals for for illegals. eg in a curly brace lang use .* ';' or  .*} and pushback }
bottom up - look at nonreducing tokens and complete by substituting an error, and perhaps a terminator

@SandMouth @shwestrick rust-analyzer uses a hand-written Pratt parser. I think you could do a decent job with tree-sitter, but not as good. https://t.co/JVWh08o2GJ

IMO a lot of it boils to iteration: file bugs for poor error messages people actually run into =&gt; fix =&gt; repeat.

@typesanitizer @SandMouth @shwestrick Agreed with all of this. Some languages maintain a corpus of bad error messages (e.g. Elm https://t.co/ltHeYzLKzD) to help track error cases.

As a smug computer algebraist, one of my pet peeves is when claims about matrices omit the crucial assumption that the entries lie in a field (and sometimes ℝ or ℂ specifically).

Random example of a false statement: the nilpotency degree of a nilpotent n x n matrix is &lt;= n.

@hillelogram Oh, here's one for Haskell, taken from "Denotational Design".

@hillelogram This is a meta-interpreter for Prolog. It's a Prolog program that implements Prolog.

In three lines, it reifies the essence of Prolog in a way that enables you to hook into and change the language.

The second program modifies Prolog to produce a proof tree alongside the search. https://t.co/1NSCj8Ee95

A programmer’s journey to computing enlightenment:

simple program: “everything runs sequentially”

systems program: “wait now everything runs at the same time”

bare metal: “oh everything actually runs sequentially”

hardware: “oh no everything runs very much at the same time”

@cfbolz @rg9119 It can't do all of the things that other systems do, but with a few tweaks it can cover a surprising number of use cases. It also has the virtue of adding very little to the language's semantics. Doesn't mean it's right for all situations, of course, but I'm still fond of it!

A simple (shared) mutex on Linux could be just 4 bytes, but a pthread_mutex_t is 40 bytes to support optional features like reentrance and robustness. By default, most fields are unused. 1/4 https://t.co/4tZQbomcDW

Time to link Clang 15 (~1.4 GiB) on a 16-core ARM64 EC2 instance:
ld.​gold: 41.3s
ld.lld: 6.6s
ld.mold: 1.0s
I believe mold is even more competitive on ARM64 than on x86 because our algo for ARM64 implemented here is more efficient than others. https://t.co/gHePSvSxrY

For ARM64, a linker has to support an interesting feature. Since all ARM instructions are at most 32 bits long, we can't fit a 32-bit displacement to a call instruction. Actually, a call insn has a 27-bit displacement, so it can jump only within ±128 MiB.

If you want to call a function further than that, you need to materialize its address in a register using multiple instructions and then jump to that address. Compiler doesn't do this -- it always optimistically emits a single call insn for every function call.

@vinodg @SandMouth I'd like to add https://t.co/1tQQYoZa3P as an excellent tutorial for shared memory programs.

Unfortunately, consistency is culturally different for computer architects, shared memory concurrency people, distributed systems people, and database people.

@SandMouth No. At least I don't. Even when teaching, I find it easier to convey "ordering" and "visibility" constraints implied by consistency models than reasoning about histories.

@SandMouth @sarah_zrf @plt_amy Not a concrete example "forall (x : infinite domain) some-decidable-proposition x" should be regular even if not decidable. That’s the shape of Euler’s polyhedra formula, and almost the shape of Riemann’s hypothesis (except that `= 1/2` seems tricky to decide for reals).

@ShriramKMurthi @hanielmbarbosa @krismicinski @sigfig @disconcision I think Toby (@tobycmurray) also teaches a course on modelling and probably uses Alloy (I could be wrong because he mentioned something like this long back in 2021). I think the course is this [1] but he would have more to say on teaching modelling.

@StefanKarpinski OCaml isn’t the only ML out there. See MLton, for example.

For OCaml though, this inefficiency is caused specifically because you don’t always know the types. Specifically, polymorphic interfaces of separately compiled units.

@shwestrick @SandMouth One motivating example is FMA. LLVM will not automatically change a*b+c to fma(a,b,c) since it will change the floating point results. This is a current #julialang issue https://t.co/0NIBLDMk0o. Using "fastmath", optimization levels, and flags are very rigid ways to do it.

@PatrickKidger Not only that, but it truly is the opposite of fastmath when you consider using it for loss functions like swapping in for operations that decrease the floating point error (something that has some promising prototypes). So it's just generally a powerful code transformation tool.

@PatrickKidger Of course, right now it's all demo and harder to use. So this is the answer to Viral's question of a 2022 goal: get this into the compiler plugin framework so that custom Julia typed IR and LLVM passes can be easily prototyped and implemented via simple rule/theory definitions.

@awsTO so yes, it will appeal to your caliber for making z3 accessible. Ideas on usability to the next level are welcome. Of-course just an appetizer for amazing mind-boggling advances. I even have a slogan: "co-z3" as in "cozy" (gptz3 sounds weird).

The Alloy 6 release completely obsoletes almost all existing Alloy training materials, since so much of that was about emulating time in the relational model and now that's completely unnecessary.

@SandMouth There is more structure in complex numbers than the reals. Eg: there are (inf.) many "complex paths" between two real numbers, in addition to the only path connecting them in the space of reals. Structural constraints satisfied on ALL those paths =&gt; more powerful analysis tools.

@SandMouth In evidence-based reasoning, evidence can either support a hypothesis, provide no support or even favor the counter-hypothesis. In the latter two cases, the proposition "the evidence supports the hypothesis" is false but what does this really say.

@SandMouth They’ve already internalized the idea that spin is a distribution and measuring collapses it to a point. For propositions the analogy is “propositions are true or false, but we don’t know which until they are proven”Probabilistic logic is notoriously hard of course.

ET Jaynes renown for the MaxEnt principle passed away in 1998 while he was writing this book. 
The book was fortunately finalized by his former PhD student George Bretthorst. See preface!

Jaynes considers probability theory as an extension of logic.

@SandMouth "Monkey patching" is often easier in dynamic languages. Consider systems where you update code at runtime without recompiling the whole program. Erlang can patch servers without bringing them down. javascript you can execute code live in the console as the page is running. etc.

@SandMouth Shell code. It is not only extremely stateful, but its control-flow and actions tend to depend very deeply on what it reads as values "from outside". What you can statically say about this is quite minimal.

@SandMouth Probabilistic programming usually works in terms of nonstandard interpretation. Static typing isn't impossible, but it tends to be either too restrictive or too verbose and complex. The latter case tends to sacrifice many advantages of static typing

@ndm_haskell @ezyang To be concrete, here I am citing our build systems paper from the code of Dune's incremental library Memo :)

I think the main distinctive feature of build systems is that they incrementalise messy external computations that mutate a messy external store.

So did this and added it into dex-lang
https://t.co/KCHN0gu8b3

DexCall.jl  functionality to allow you to call dex-lang functions from JuliaLang.
It's pretty nice, it compiles the Dex code at Julia's compile-time(*) so it should be pretty fast.

(* technically at parse time).

@SandMouth Sounds more likely to work. The problem with combinators is they replace explicit arguments with annoying argument-shuffling code, and then the egraph can go wild thinking up all sorts of clever ways to shuffle arguments.

---

### [Tweet ID: 1425964057085943810](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1425964057085943810)
@SandMouth But keep in mind: with full defunctionalization, you can't reason under a binder. Which might have been the whole reason you wanted your lambdas in an egraph.

---

### [Tweet ID: 1425952544509947912](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1425952544509947912)
@SandMouth I've tried it, and also some smarter combinator libraries. At least in my use case it didn't work well, because there were too many uninteresting combinator rewrites: apply took too many iterations and by that point the egraph had blown up. Clever scheduling might fix that.

@SandMouth Nice! Is datalog just an egraph? Or are egraphs just datalog? I’ve mostly been thinking about the latter, but this is the former. I think either can be true with some squinting, and it’s certainly fun to see what you can learn from doing said squinting!

I'm a really big fan of just diving into hard problems and new fields without worrying too much, as long as after a week or two of rapid prototyping and hands-on learning I maintain the ability to step back and reevaluate and talk to the right people before continuing

@bgavran3 @SandMouth @tangled_zans @chrislpenner @tonyday567 @ocramz_yo @conal You might also want to look into Selective functors in Haskell, which I currently use for much the same kind of purpose.

@SandMouth @bgavran3 @tangled_zans @chrislpenner @tonyday567 @ocramz_yo @conal There is a very nice connection when you make those arrows linear, because then s -o (a, b -o t) is precisely the same notion as a constant complement encoding, because b -o t is exactly the right size to be the complement.

@SandMouth @bgavran3 @tangled_zans @chrislpenner @tonyday567 @ocramz_yo @conal Now to make this interesting, the real question is if you can try to use that to borrow efficiencies for lenses from those other encodings. e.g. the intrinsic sharing and asymptotic win from the bidirectional walk of a Wengert list, etc.

@SandMouth @tangled_zans @chrislpenner @tonyday567 @ocramz_yo @kmett @conal This is an opinion I have too, but I don't think I know enough to say for sure. Certainly some stuff is still fuzzy to me when it comes to dealing with continuations in AD and its relation to (linear) lenses

I've just added `and` to my toy lisp compiler: https://t.co/AsQTct0Pfh

It's just a plain function, not a macro or special form. Is that so bad? I've seen confusing uses of `and` with truthiness e.g. `(and maybe-nil (compute-default))` and I'd rather avoid that.

@SandMouth 👍 In addition to the automatic tactics covered in the post, you might want to check things like field, congruence (EUF solver), intuition, firstorder, and some powerful combinations like 'firstorder congruence'. And also, CoqHammer's sauto and hammer, see https://t.co/PYjDjk9kYj

@SandMouth @jonmsterling It's done via reflection, similar to the monoid solver. We take a morphism, embed it into the category of copresheaves, then apply the identity morphism to get a normalized term out.

The code is over at https://t.co/gM1spkoxIU if you want to take a peek

The three stages of any big formalisation project:

1. It's impossible. Don't even try.
2. It might technically be possible but it's completely unfeasible.
3. Cool, you did it!
4. Actually, it was trivial and is barely worth mentioning.

My thought is that forcing kids to think about pre/post conditions and loop invariants when they're learning to code will develop better habits in the long run

@SandMouth @dancherp @ezyang Fair point; indeed a full int takes 4 bytes instead of 8, and sometimes some pointers can be saved — arrays and heaps store no indexes at all. And you also get spatial locality from contiguous allocations — CPUs read mem in 64-byte cachelines.

@SandMouth @dancherp @ezyang Data structures with pointers have less locality b/c (a) pointers waste space without storing actual data (b) nodes are not contiguous.
In Java you can easily waste 90% of mem (there's an OOPSLA paper) but even in C a linked list of ints wastes &gt;=75% of mem on 64bit platforms.

@wicko3 @shwestrick It's not that strange. The extra let gives you a copy of the body of the function stored in the ref, preventing the tying of the recursive knot in store.

@SandMouth @cambridgecqc @SymPy I'm not sure Iunderstand the distinction between synthetic and automatic diff very well. I'd say we're doing something in between the two: at the level of diagrams it's symbolic, once you interpret those diagrams as numpy code, it begins to feel more automatic.

AIUI, fwd AD pushes “changes” around, represented by reals. Does reverse AD push around linear  “continuations” R -&gt; R?

  1. The GHC compilation/optimization model is really neat.

  2. I don’t love how much GHC heap allocates.

  3. I really don’t like how much code bloat the optimizer routinely creates.

A common optimization to real-time fluid simulations in computer graphics is to use a "Multigrid" algorithm to acceleration the solver.

This process is often fraught with pitfalls, and there are few references on the expected result.

This aims to serve as one such reference. https://t.co/3SlbkhyYZw

Langevin Monte Carlo allows you to draw samples from a probability distribution using its log gradient ∇ log p(x).

By performing a sort of gradient ascent with noise you can navigate around the distribution.  

Langevin MC is heavily related to modern diffusion models. https://t.co/lIx0FYM2Y6

Different kinds of random walks ("stochastic processes") can be used to express solutions to many fundamental equations found in science &amp; engineering ("PDEs"). These can in turn be used to develop Monte Carlo solvers.

Here I visually catalog a few of the connections.

CGAL and geogram both use Sylvain Pion's predicate filter generator (FPG), that computes "almost-static" filters.

I am not sure, but I presume that the bounds computed by Gappa are for *static* filters (this may explain).

A function f : P(X) → R is submodular if for all A ⊆ B ⊆ X and x ∉ B, f(A ∪ {x}) - f(A) ≥ f(B ∪ {x}) - f(B). This is a law of diminishing returns -- adding x to B is less effective than adding x to A if A ⊆ B. These functions can be minimized in strongly polynomial time.

I've had a lot of fun designing and teaching a course on classic "imperative" data structures and algorithms *in OCaml* at Yale-NUS College in 2019-2022. 

As it's not going to be offered ever again, I'm making all its materials public. Enjoy!

Since the paper's under open review I considered writing it there - but it's way off-topic for a NeurIPS workshop

To be fair: Differentiable programming folks are doing exciting stuff and racing towards revolutionising machine learning. The lenses perspective is very interesting, but could be just a curiosity

Gauss was first to use the term "complex number" in an 1831 article about a book he'd just published. He spends some time explaining the geometry of complex numbers to show how they have many parts (e.g. "a complex" in English) but *aren't* complicated. https://t.co/uKq6CHsg3G

When you're trying to reproduce a well-known result and keep getting a different answer, it's worth asking yourself:

"Am I wrong, or is the whole field wrong?"

**spoiler alert** 

you're probably wrong

I had great discussions at ZuriHac about GRIN, STG, LLVM and  ASAP Memory Management. It's cool that other compiler geeks also see how GRIN and STG model could be combined to cover the full spectrum of compilation unit size. i.e. module, library, whole program.

Data.ByteString doesn't need to store an offset! 

ForeignPtr addresses are disconnected from the contents they manage, and the machinery to implement this has been available to us since GHC 7.0.

Theil–Sen and Siegel estimators. 

These are non-parametric, distribution-free methods for fitting a line to data, in a way that is very robust to noise and outliers — and often even more accurate then standard least-squares!

@SandMouth Replacement matches list comprehensions alla `map(λx: x*x-x, range(9))`

Specification doesn't use it fully, just the `filter` part.

As soon as you got recursion, or alternatively iteration over N, your `specify` allows for set not terminating in the REPL, and you lose choice.

@breandan @java @kotlin Alternatively, replace matrices (concrete representation) by linear maps (abstract notion) in the API, where the domain and codomain are explicit *types*, not sizes. More general, compositional, simple, and safe than matrices. (And no dependent types needed.)

There's a definite possibility that, while trying to understand machine learning via category theory, we will accidentally invent "generalised machine learning". If this happens, we will of course confirm what everybody thinks about category theorists.

Many ferrite beads are surprisingly susceptible to external magnetic fields. Even laminated ferrite beads can easily couple noise for example from a nearby switching regulator into the net that they are meant to filter. I recently observed this problem with a low noise design… https://t.co/Ot4grAbPaY

@ezyang @yashv_singh You can associate for each equivalence class the other classes that it is "definitely not equal to", i.e., there was at some point an inequality such that one of the elements was part of this class and the other was part of the class that this one is definitely not equal to.

Won 7 benchmarks out 8. I was hoping for a clear win, but apparently I still have things to optimize on Arm 💪

The benchmarks are very easy to repeat: https://t.co/0kMpeUAKz1 https://t.co/OQhmxMdYy8

@SoosMate Yes (about the role of Kitten in Kissat) but the explanation is still bogus. It sounds like a weak student who does not understand anything but tries to pass the exam by randomly arguing about concepts discussed in this context. I probably would let it pass (but just).

I started to sketch a NVIDIA A100 emulator to build intuition on how GPUs execute code. But it got out of hand and now I am building a PTX assembly parser too... Surely someone else already built this? Something like QEMU but for GPUs instead of CPUs? I just want to use one...

I went from ccache-based 5-second recompiles to nix, where it's instantaneous if it's identical, and otherwise, you better have the gods on your side, it's single-threaded, recompiles EVERYTHING (compiler included!), no compile cache.

As far as I can tell, λProlog seems to be completely forgotten. Which is too bad. It's a cool language, I wonder why it never took off--seems like there was never a real focus on any implementation effort, and the semantics makes some high-performance implementation nontrivial..

I wonder how much of (bidirectional) type checking can be folded into just inference plus subsumption:

check e t =
  e_t &lt;- infer e
  subsumes e_t t

I guess atomic expressions like literals are but care has to be given for stuff like variables, which duplicates code but eh.

You should write an article for Phrack #71 !! I hear it's coming out by summer time. 👀

Let's open the windows and get some phresh air back into the scene.

Somebody submitted Live++ to the orange site and the comments did not disappoint.

It's simple: use DLLs, reload them, and tell your devs to never use anything stateful like globals, function statics, or TLS. Done.

@ShriramKMurthi When I teach metaprogramming, I do credit Lisp on the programming side, and largely Quine on the Logic side, for getting things started.

But I'm not a big believer in raw quote/eval, or even templates/quasiquotes. There are better ways to do metaprogramming nowadays.

@SandMouth @notjfmc LLVM you get at that suite of tooling like seahorn, divine, symbiotic etc. Llvm to C is ok if you don't need to restructure control flow, you can get rid of the hard part of rellic. I think both ways end up quite similar tbh. Indeed remill uses pcode to bootstrap semantics anyway

Let's do another one! In IZF, if you can define a set generically in terms of another one, e.g. S(a) where a is a set variable, then you can consider the product over *all sets* of s, that is Π a ∈ V. S(a) and *assume that it is a set*!

One would expect this to be "too big".

What I take from this is: if the formula P–⋆Q is Quite Awful™, the formula P⋆(P–⋆Q) is absolutely fine. This rules out the rubbish.

And you can get some extra oomph by using first-order logic with P(x)⋆(∀y. P(y)–⋆Q(y)). https://t.co/2O4YQu5cdh

Now I think I should quit CS altogether.

a popular alternative is called a DCEL, or a half-edge data structure

here, the different elements have references (in green) to other elements, which makes it easier to traverse around a polygon, or across edges into other polygons (which don't have to be triangles anymore) https://t.co/Uxjf8H28jC

If there’d been such a thing like Database Internals II, what would you like to see in it?

I’ll start: code. Def not production-grade, deliberately simplified, but technically equivalent to what you’d see in a real database, with clear cut abstractions even if they hurt perf.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Common Lisp has the best error handling system of any language.
(It's very much like an effect system. However, effect systems always build-in continuations, which aren't actually needed most of the time.)

Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models

Develop the method the model first (1) drafts an initial response; then (2) plans and answers verification questions; and (3) generates its final verified response.

Niche tweet, but "Set Theory and the Continuum Problem" by Smullyan and Fitting is BY FAR the cleanest book I've ever read in terms of proofs.

Almost everything is written out, almost no "it is clear that..." or "one can verify..."

3/ The linker knows whether the address of a function is taken or not, so it can replace endbr64 with a nop if a function's address isn't taken (i.e. the function is not called via a pointer). Does this really improve the security? I don't know. But maybe it's worth a try.

Use Laplace's equation:
1. Mesh the maze
2. Set Dirichlet BCs ϕ = 0 at start and ϕ = 1 at end
3. Set homogeneous Neumann BCs everywhere else
4. Solve ∇²ϕ = 0
5. Go to the start and follow the gradient https://t.co/vUNlpGUET0

In the era of stable diffusion, the answer seems to be: synthetic! 

One stable diffusion sample can be worth more than one real image.

Many folks have written me about my lectures on continuations. Although this was only a single lecture it’s the only one I ever get emails about. In response I am working to film some follow up tutorials on more advanced usages of various kinds of continuations.

It is hard to find another language that has the same niceness factor as OCaml, but only if you discount the fact that it's mind-numbingly hard in OCaml to just print something for debugging purposes. If they could only fix that! https://t.co/J5yDolCLPj https://t.co/X0vvGRzhgX

@krismicinski @SandMouth My hot take is that Let needs to be a primitive rather than syntactic sugar

if you remove lambda abstraction from your language and keep let, you will have a syntax for cartesian multicategories, as opposed to cartesian closed multicategories.

2. E-matching, a core procedure of EqSat, is slow. Our previous work on relational e-matching tries to address this by reducing e-matching to relational queries. But it is unsatisfying as now we need to convert between the relational representation and the graph representation.

1. Sound rewrite rules are sometimes hard to specify syntactically. For instance, x / x =&gt; 0 is only sound when x is not 0. E-class analyses somewhat mitigate this issue, but they're limited in the kind of analyses they support. As a result, EqSat in tools like Herbie is unsound.

@SandMouth @yihongz_bot One reason that chrs may be not that fast is that they don't use a hash cons table for such queries. I think you can recognize rules of the form R(a,b,x,y) /\ R(a,b,x',y') and then use a hash table on (a,b) to detect whether they trigger.

@SandMouth I think equality saturation can be encoded as syntactic sugar on top of CHRs, given that you can implement union-find in CHRs and allocate new IDs and represent function symbols z = f(x,y) as relations f(id_x, id_y, id_z). Though you might want a native union find for speed.

@krismicinski @geofflangdale The initial Sail RISC-V spec was done in academia, as a basis for CHERI RISC-V, as were our other models.

The window functions ROW_NUMBER, RANK and DENSE_RANK can be used for such queries.

Compiler tidbit: computing which variables are live at an instruction depends on which are live in the following instruction. But what if there are cycles in the control flow? Start with no live variables at every instruction and recompute until the answer stops changing.

@SandMouth well, sure, but then that's just plain not Datalog anymore. I'm not trying to be offensive here at all to you, as I completely agree, but I just would say; yeah, monotonic aggregation up a lattice is plainly more expressive than Datalog, as you know, of course.

@SandMouth @krismicinski Yeah I mean all of the discussion here about sound provenance ignores the RE usecase imo. They'd rather apply destructive optimizations since it's useful for a human. This provenance preserving stuff is honestly only optimal in recomp or static analysis scenarios imo

@SandMouth @2over124 unsoundness is introduced, and the result is a robust artifact (i.e., algebraic structure) that perfectly reflects these decisions and all analysis upon which it was derived. Many folks won't need this--those folks can just still use IDA / etc.. and get their work done!

@SandMouth @2over124 totally agreed, here is the argument I would make: decompilation is different than compilation because dealing with undecidable decisions is intrinsic (even symbolization is undecidable!), rather than optional (compiler optimization)--thus, we must carefully audit where

@krismicinski @SandMouth Going down this road has often made me wonder if "look like source" is even a useful goal. In inverting all of the nightmare things a compiler will do your facts and decisions become too isolated and specific imo, while I'm not sure how useful attempting to do so really is

@SandMouth yeah--to me it seems natural to expect that decompilers must be written relationally, i.e., they produce sets of things that could have been the originally-compiled source (modulo some equivalence, obviously the tricky part is how to tame this), and then concretized

@SandMouth I think we mostly agree here--that the best approach would be to have a tower of IRs, each with higher-and-higher-level semantic annotations derived via analysis reified as a semantic object, starting with datalog disassembly, and thus explicating sources of potential unsoundness

Hmmm, so is it possible to have an Immix heap without compaction?

I kinda want to avoid forwarding pointers as long as possible.

More reading to do…

@shwestrick yes, it is. In this case it's a fork of our main Datalog engine (MPI-based) to scale "recursive monotonic aggregates," i.e., a monotonic join operation in a repeated loop with Horn-SAT. Right now we're just working on the backend (C++ code to which DL would compile).

Devs I look up to talk about "cache friendly data structures/code" and I'm the idiot over here wondering how on earth you measure this.

Well TIL

Awesome! It's not a mysterious thing. It's something you can just get numbers on.

Something for you SQLite fans to keep an eye on!

It's an attempt at an open SQLite contributor model (via fork) with some interesting changes in mind like using Rust for new features, supporting io_uring, etc.

Whether successful or not, a worthy effort.

@mwillsey @hackedy A slightly more useful sufficient condition people have been talking about is to ensure that RHS does not contain existentially quantified vars so that it can’t make new e-nodes. This gives you essentially standard Datalog (which always terminates).

Difference of convex (DC) programming is a very general framework &amp; it can be used for many nonconvex optimization problems.

However, I would strongly recommend to experiment with its convex relaxations first.
