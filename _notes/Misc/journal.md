Nice weekend. Went to the aquarium with connie. Got Taro, japanese food. Five spices house in Central.
I showed up late to sunday dinner. I felt bad. I communicated poorly. I should try to do better. We played a camel betting board game. I was shocked to enjoy it.

Learning about floating point and concurrency.
