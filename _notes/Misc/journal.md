Nice weekend. Went to the aquarium with connie. Got Taro, japanese food. Five spices house in Central.
I showed up late to sunday dinner. I felt bad. I communicated poorly. I should try to do better. We played a camel betting board game. I was shocked to enjoy it.

Learning about floating point and concurrency.

Week in zion wth the fam. Really nice. On a plane going to colorado for VIBES. Into term rewriting. Getting out there dating. Maybe my mind is healing from the awfulness of the last year. Started jogging. Took a spill and really destroyed my pinky. Hanging out with buddy this weekend at my place was neat.
