It's MY data.

- <https://github.com/JeffCarpenter/export-stars/tree/master/export_stars>

Edit to
to get

```

    auth = Auth.Login(USERNAME    PASSSWORD) 
    #gh = Github(args.token    retry=config_retry()) if args.token else Github(retry=config_retry())
    gh = Github(auth=auth)

```

Find and replace comma by spaces. Pandoc didn't work so good. find and replace `\n<` with `\n- <`
