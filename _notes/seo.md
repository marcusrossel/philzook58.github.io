Ah, SEO (search engine optimization). What a dirty thing. But don't I want to be loved by all?

Hilariously I had the canonical link messed up in my blog for a while. I wonder if that stopped people from visiting it successfully.

Tips:
- Write good descriptions
- write short permalinks
- Use alt text on images
- Use descriptive text on links instead of just "here"
- give an image description to each post
- add a 404.html page


Tools:
- Lighthouse: It's in Chrome's developer tab. Isn't that cool?
