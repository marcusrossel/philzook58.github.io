Ah, SEO (search engine optimization). What a dirty thing. But don't I want to be loved by all?

Hilariously I had the canonical link messed up in my blog for a while. I wonder if that stopped people from visiting it successfully.

Tips:
- Write good descriptions
- write short permalinks
- Use alt text on images
- Use descriptive text on links instead of just "here"


Tools:
- Lighthouse: It's in Chrome's developer tab. Isn't that cool?
- [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)
- [Rich Results Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
