"The Lean typeclass resolution procedure can be viewed as a
simple Î»-Prolog interpreter [8], where the Horn clauses are the user declared
instances."
That sounds fun

### Build

`elan` tool

`leanpkg`

[`lake`](https://github.com/leanprover/lake) is a new build tool on the horizon. analog of cargo
Making a lake project is a way to get the standard lib?
<https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/lakefile.lean> mathlib4 lakefile

```lake
require std from git "https://github.com/leanprover/std4" @ "main"
require Qq from git "https://github.com/gebner/quote4" @ "master"
require aesop from git "https://github.com/JLimperg/aesop" @ "master
```

Using nix is kind of a pain. I haven't done it.

Ah. I need to open my lake project in it's own window for vscode to work right resolving paths. That is weird. Hmm.

LEAN_PATH for libraries? Probably I'm fighting the Lake experience which is bad.
