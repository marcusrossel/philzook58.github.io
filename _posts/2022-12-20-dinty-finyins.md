I thought (again) this would be the year we failed. Dave saved the day with a good name and Ben and I, over an early kind of nasty diner breakfast, hashed out a way to use that in something we could shoot and edit with what we had available. Pretty pleased! The amount of editing that it requires to get something whose timing feels right is incredible. It's also surprising how fractions of a second feel like they matter a lot. We had it in the can by 5:30 though. Then we had tacos and shot the shit with Will. A rich birthday tradition.
