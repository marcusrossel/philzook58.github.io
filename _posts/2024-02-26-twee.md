title: Automated Equational Reasoning with Twee Pt 1.
---

Manipulating equations on a computer is very tantalizing.

[Twee](https://nick8325.github.io/twee/) is an off the shelf equational prover that is underutilized in this arena.
You can install it, get readable equational proofs out, have it find interesting terms, and dump out a rewrite system that may have very useful properties.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/nick8325/twee/blob/master/tests/deriv.p ) of it using an equational specification of differentiation to derive an antiderivative.
It's very impressive in my opinion. The proof output is quite clean and it also returns the instantiation of the existential. Used in this manner, twee is an antidifferentiation engine, which is pretty cool.

```bash
%%bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | BOOTSTRAP_HASKELL_NONINTERACTIVE=1 sh
apt install libgmp-dev
!PATH=~/.ghcup/bin:$PATH cabal install twee
```

```python
%%file /tmp/deriv.p
% Axioms about arithmetic.

cnf('commutativity of +', axiom,
    X + Y = Y + X).
cnf('associativity of +', axiom,
    X + (Y + Z) = (X + Y) + Z).

    X * Y = Y * X).

```

```python
!twee /tmp/deriv.p --quiet --no-color
```

    The conjecture is true! Here is a proof.
    
    Axiom 1 (derivative of x): d(x) = 1.
    Axiom 2 (commutativity of +): X + Y = Y + X.
    Axiom 3 (plus 0): 0 + X = X.
    Axiom 4 (commutativity of *): X * Y = Y * X.
    Axiom 5 (times 1): 1 * X = X.
    Axiom 6 (minus): X + -X = 0.
    Axiom 7 (derivative of +): d(X + Y) = d(X) + d(Y).
    Axiom 8 (associativity of +): X + (Y + Z) = (X + Y) + Z.
    Axiom 9 (derivative of sin): d(sin(X)) = cos(X) * d(X).
    Axiom 10 (derivative of cos): d(cos(X)) = -(sin(X) * d(X)).
    Axiom 11 (derivative of *): d(X * Y) = (X * d(Y)) + (Y * d(X)).
    
    Lemma 12: X * 1 = X.
    Proof:
      X * 1
    = { by axiom 4 (commutativity of *) R->L }
      1 * X
    = { by axiom 5 (times 1) }
      X
    
    Goal 1 (goal): d(X) = x * cos(x).
    The goal is true when:
      X = cos(x) + (x * sin(x))
    
    Proof:
      d(cos(x) + (x * sin(x)))
    = { by axiom 4 (commutativity of *) R->L }
      d(cos(x) + (sin(x) * x))
    = { by axiom 7 (derivative of +) }
      d(cos(x)) + d(sin(x) * x)
    = { by axiom 10 (derivative of cos) }
      -(sin(x) * d(x)) + d(sin(x) * x)
    = { by axiom 1 (derivative of x) }
      -(sin(x) * 1) + d(sin(x) * x)
    = { by lemma 12 }
      -sin(x) + d(sin(x) * x)
    = { by axiom 2 (commutativity of +) R->L }
      d(sin(x) * x) + -sin(x)
    = { by axiom 11 (derivative of *) }
      ((sin(x) * d(x)) + (x * d(sin(x)))) + -sin(x)
    = { by axiom 1 (derivative of x) }
      ((sin(x) * 1) + (x * d(sin(x)))) + -sin(x)
    = { by lemma 12 }
      (sin(x) + (x * d(sin(x)))) + -sin(x)
    = { by axiom 8 (associativity of +) R->L }
      sin(x) + ((x * d(sin(x))) + -sin(x))
    = { by axiom 2 (commutativity of +) }
      sin(x) + (-sin(x) + (x * d(sin(x))))
    = { by axiom 8 (associativity of +) }
      (sin(x) + -sin(x)) + (x * d(sin(x)))
    = { by axiom 6 (minus) }
      0 + (x * d(sin(x)))
    = { by axiom 3 (plus 0) }
      x * d(sin(x))
    = { by axiom 9 (derivative of sin) }
      x * (cos(x) * d(x))
    = { by axiom 1 (derivative of x) }
      x * (cos(x) * 1)
    = { by lemma 12 }
      x * cos(x)
    
    RESULT: Theorem (the conjecture is true).

## Group Theory

Group theory provides some nice simple examples of equational proofs. For example, it is not at all obvious that the left inverse must be the same as the right inverse, or that the left and right identities must be the same.
Instead of groups, you could also use rings, fields, or any other algebraic structure (more exotic things like loops and [robbins algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_algebra) have had success used tools from the ATP world).

```python
%%file /tmp/group.p

cnf(right_identity, axiom, X * id = X).
cnf(right_inverse, axiom, X * inv(X) = id).
cnf(associativity, axiom, (X * (Y * Z)) = ((X * Y) * Z)).

cnf(left_inverse, conjecture, inv(X) * X = id).
%cnf(left_identity, conjecture, id * X = X).

```

    Overwriting /tmp/group.p

```python
!twee /tmp/group.p --no-color
```

    Here is the input problem:
      Axiom 1 (right_identity): X * id = X.
      Axiom 2 (flattening): *2 = id * x.
      Axiom 3 (right_inverse): X * inv(X) = id.
      Axiom 4 (associativity): X * (Y * Z) = (X * Y) * Z.
      Goal 1 (left_identity): id * x = x.
    
    1. X * id -> X
    2. id * x -> *2
    3. X * inv(X) -> id
    4. (X * Y) * Z -> X * (Y * Z)
    5. X * (id * Y) -> X * Y
    6. X * x -> X * *2
    7. id * *2 -> *2
    8. X * inv(id) -> X
    9. id * (x * X) -> *2 * X
    10. *2 * inv(x) -> id
    11. X * (inv(X) * Y) -> id * Y
    12. id * inv(inv(X)) -> X
    13. X * (x * Y) -> X * (*2 * Y)
    14. X * inv(inv(Y)) -> X * Y
    15. id * X -> X
    16. x -> *2
    
    The conjecture is true! Here is a proof.
    
    Axiom 1 (right_identity): X * id = X.
    Axiom 2 (right_inverse): X * inv(X) = id.
    Axiom 3 (associativity): X * (Y * Z) = (X * Y) * Z.
    
    Lemma 4: X * (inv(X) * Y) = id * Y.
    Proof:
      X * (inv(X) * Y)
    = { by axiom 3 (associativity) }
      (X * inv(X)) * Y
    = { by axiom 2 (right_inverse) }
      id * Y
    
    Lemma 5: id * inv(inv(X)) = X.
    Proof:
      id * inv(inv(X))
    = { by lemma 4 R->L }
      X * (inv(X) * inv(inv(X)))
    = { by axiom 2 (right_inverse) }
      X * id
    = { by axiom 1 (right_identity) }
      X
    
    Goal 1 (left_identity): id * x = x.
    Proof:
      id * x
    = { by lemma 4 R->L }
      X * (inv(X) * x)
    = { by lemma 5 R->L }
      X * (inv(X) * (id * inv(inv(x))))
    = { by axiom 3 (associativity) }
      X * ((inv(X) * id) * inv(inv(x)))
    = { by axiom 1 (right_identity) }
      X * (inv(X) * inv(inv(x)))
    = { by lemma 4 }
      id * inv(inv(x))
    = { by lemma 5 }
      x
    
    RESULT: Theorem (the conjecture is true).

# Egraphs and Ground Rewriting

I think it's very interesting that if you give twee a ground system of equalities, the resulting rewrite system can be interpreted as an egraph.

If you give it an impossible to prove goal condition, it will fail. It prints out the normalized rewrite system. This is an egraph. The right hand side is a canonical term for that equivalence class and left hand sides are possible other terms in that eclass. If you filled it out with symbols for eclass.

I wrote more about this perspective here <https://www.philipzucker.com/egraph-ground-rewrite/>

One toy problem I like is that an egraph will find the greatest common divisor of a loopy set of equations

```python
%%file /tmp/egraph.p

cnf(eq1, axiom, foo(foo(a)) = a).
cnf(eq2, axiom, foo(foo(foo(a))) = a).

cnf(false, conjecture, true = false).

```

    Writing /tmp/egraph.p

```python
!twee /tmp/egraph.p --no-color
```

    Here is the input problem:
      Axiom 1 (eq1): foo(foo(a)) = a.
      Axiom 2 (eq2): foo(foo(foo(a))) = a.
      Goal 1 (false): true = false.
    
    1. foo(foo(a)) -> a
    2. foo(a) -> a
    
    Ran out of critical pairs. This means the conjecture is not true.
    Here is the final rewrite system:
      foo(a) -> a
    
    RESULT: CounterSatisfiable (the conjecture is false).

Perhaps more simple, the resulting ground rewrite system is a normalized / compressed union find. The right hand side is a canonical element, and the left hand side are all the things in the same union find set.

```python
%%file /tmp/unionfind.p
cnf(ax1, axiom, a = b).
cnf(ax2, axiom, b = c).
cnf(ax3, axiom, c = d).
cnf(ax4, axiom, d = e).
cnf(ax5, axiom, f = g).

cnf(false, conjecture, true = false).
```

    Writing /tmp/unionfind.p

```python
!twee /tmp/unionfind.p --no-color
```

    Here is the input problem:
      Axiom 1 (ax5): f = g.
      Axiom 2 (ax1): a = b.
      Axiom 3 (ax2): b = c.
      Axiom 4 (ax4): d = e.
      Axiom 5 (ax3): c = d.
      Goal 1 (false): true = false.
    
    1. g -> f
    2. b -> a
    3. c -> a
    4. d -> e
    5. e -> a
    
    Ran out of critical pairs. This means the conjecture is not true.
    Here is the final rewrite system:
      b -> a
      c -> a
      d -> a
      e -> a
      g -> f
    
    RESULT: CounterSatisfiable (the conjecture is false).

You can also use twee to do something analogous to egraph saturation if you add in the actual rewrite rules. This is particularly interesting because term rewriting sytems are more clear cut on how you could add theories, lambdas, etc, because things are just terms.

If you give Twee an early stopping criterion, it dumps out the currently discovered rewriting system. You can see the available early stopping criteria in --expert-help

```
Resource limits:
  --max-term-size <num>
    Discard rewrite rules whose left-hand side is bigger than this limit (unlimited by default).
  --max-cps <num>
    Give up after considering this many critical pairs (unlimited by default).
  --max-cp-depth <num>
    Only consider critical pairs up to this depth (unlimited by default).
```

### What is equational search

Equational proof search is not that complicated in principle. You are given an initial term to start out with and you are seeking some goal term. This can be thought of as a graph search with reachable terms as nodes and applying some equation as an edge. You could apply all the regular depth first, breadth first, A*, Beam etc search algorithms.

There is more structure here though and it is typically perceived that a graph search like this is too brute force. I actually don't think people try it that much before going to fancier techniques.

An alternate starting point is the idea of simplification by term rewriting. Some of your equations are orientable into rewrite rules that are obviously simplifying your term in some sense. Many equational problems do feel to be of the form "give me a term equivalent to term `foo(x)` that is simpler". Most automated equational manipulation in the world is greedy rewriting of this form.

Simplifying rewrite rules are not incompatible with throwing some search on top, but it now takes more thoughts and concepts. If you have two rewrite rules that could fire, you could do a search considering both choices.
This work is redundant if your system of rewrite rules is sufficiently nice. If your system of rules is confluent and terminating, then you can apply the rules greedily willy nilly and always end up at the same "simplest" result regardless of rule application order. In this case, you can also determined _inequality_ of terms.

I keep my eye on the various solver competitions.
<https://www.tptp.org/CASC/29/WWWFiles/DivisionSummary1.html> In 2023, for "unit equality CNF" [Twee](https://nick8325.github.io/twee/) did very well. Unit equality CNF is is an unfortunately confusing jargon for pure equational.
Twee is a theorem prover for equational logic. It is implemented in Haskell, not that that matters much to a user.

Twee is also a relatively simple system compared to Vampire and E, it's more general and close competitors. This is importance when you want to use the solver in more ways than the strictly allows "proved such and such conjecture" more. The remnant rewrite system is of great interest in and of itself as shown from egraph rewriting.

It is useful to always look at the options available in any command line tool.

`--expert-help`
`--conjecture n` although it didn't seem to work?

# Python Metaprogramming

I don't _love_ the TPTP format. It's a bit clunky and repetitive. Twee supports infix operations as an extension, but I would like other niceties and abstractions.

There are advantages I believe to having a metaprogrammble metalanguage. Python is a reasonable one.

Parsing the output of the proofs and rewrite systems is also useful. The rewrite systems are analagous to a final datalog database, or an egraph. Not every thing I want to do takes the form of "prove this two sided equation". Term extraction is also of paramount interest for less theorem provy applications.

The Knuckledragger approach is to chain together solves to automated provers with a light trust framework gluing in between.

```python
def tptp(sexp):
    return f"{sexp[0]}({','.join(map(tptp, sexp[1:]))})" if isinstance(sexp, list) else str(sexp)


class Const(str):
    #def __init__(self, name):
    #    self.name = name
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return Expr(["=", self, other])
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Expr(["+", self, other])
    def __mul__(self, other):
        return Expr(["*", self, other])
    def __rshift__(self, other):
        return Expr(["comp", self, other])
    def __matmul__(self, B):
        return Expr(["@", self, B])
    def __neg__(self):
        return Expr(["-", self])

class Expr(list):
    def __repr__(self):
        return tptp(self)
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return Expr(["=", self, other])
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Expr(["+", self, other])
    def __mul__(self, other):
        return Expr(["*", self, other])
    def __rshift__(self, other):
        return Expr(["comp", self, other])
    def __matmul__(self, B):
        return Expr(["@", self, B])
    def __neg__(self):
        return Expr(["-", self])


def function(name):
    def res(*args):
        return Expr([name, *args])
    return res
def functions(names):
    names = names.split()
    return map(function, names)
def consts(x):
    return map(Const, x.split())
X,Y,x = consts("X Y x")
f,g = functions("f g")
tptp(f(X))

type(f(X))
X + Y


```

# Knuckledragger Calc

We can chain together calls to Twee or other equational provers with a protected theorem datatype or via keeping a recording of the trace of calls (a proof object).

There are examples of `calc` tactics elsewhere in lean and dafny. Rather than using the raw inference rules, we can write down an equational proof

You can also calc chain equalities of boolean expressions that are the same.
Calc also supports an inequality modes

Adding forall.

```python
from knuckledragger.kernel import infer
class Calc():
    def __init__(self, lhs, rhs, ctx = []):
        self.terms = [lhs]
        self.thm = infer(ctx, lhs == lhs)
        self.thms = []
        self.goal = rhs
        self.ctx = ctx
    def then(self, rhs, by=[]): # step? rw?
        thm = infer(by + self.ctx, self.terms[-1] == rhs)
        self.thm = infer([thm, self.thm], self.terms[0] == rhs)
        self.thms.append(thm)
        self.terms.append(rhs)
        return self
    def __eq__(self,rhs): #sadly the way python expands multiple == this does not work that great. needs parens
        return self.then(rhs)
    def simp(): # use z3 simplify. Weak though becaus can't be context aware
        self.
        return self
    def egg_simp(self):

    def sympy():
        return self
        pass # use sympy to simplify, use z3 to confirm
    def qed(self, by=[]):
        if self.terms[-1] is not self.goal:
            self.then(self.goal, by=by)
        return self.thm
    
def calc(*steps): # a different syntax for calc
    pf = Calc(steps[0], steps[-1])
    for t in steps[1:-1]:
        pf = pf.then(t)
    return pf

from knuckledragger.kernel import trust
from z3 import *
Atom = DeclareSort("Atom")
a,b,c,d = Consts("a b c d", Atom)
ab = trust(a == b)
bc = trust(b == c)
cd = trust(c == d)
pf = Calc(a, d).then(b, by=[ab]).then(c, by=[bc]).then(d, by=[cd])
ad = pf.qed()
ad
#Calc(a,d, ctx=[ab,bc,cd]) == b == c == d 
#((Calc(a,d, ctx=[ab,bc,cd]) == b) == c) == d
```

## Functional Programming

One of the appeals of pure functional programming a la Haskell is that you can manipulate programs with pen and paper as you would an algebraic expression. With a simple manipulation you can express loop rearrangements that are rather complex. This is analogous in some respects to manipulating matrix expressions. The associativity of matrix multiplication is actually a somewhat complicated loop rearrangement too.

## Logic

Boolean (or otherwise) logic itself can be encoded as equational manipulation. This is perhaps not surprising, since boolean algebra is an algebra, and has it's roots in analogy the the equational manipulation of polynomials. Boole himself I believe noted that `true ~ 1`, `false ~ 0` `and ~ time` `or ~ plus` `not ~ 1 - x` and so on.

You can encode trig and algebraic identities. This may be distressingly inefficient though. Maybe mixing a grobner basis system and a knuth bendix system better would work?

When I was more focussed on physics, basically all mathematics was equational manipulation. The generic facilities of sympy and Mathematica fall into this category (they also have massive piles of domain specific smarts about odes, pdes, special functions, etc).
The manipulations of algebraic equations or [trigonometric identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities). Things like `cos(X)^2 + sin(X)^2 = 1`

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematical_identities> anything called an identity is probably equational.

Some of the most interesting applications (integrals, summation) seem to require bound variables to model naturally. This is a perpetual bummer. The antiderivative example above is kind of a counterexample though. There are "coordinate free" styles that don't use indices or bound variables. These seem more appropriate

```python
%%file /tmp/trig.p

cnf(pythag, axiom, cos(X) * cos(X) + sin(X) * sin(X) = '1').
cnf(sin_sum, axiom, sin(X + Y) = sin(X) * cos(Y) + cos(X) * sin(Y)).
cnf(cos_sum, axiom, cos(X + Y) = cos(X) * cos(Y) - sin(X) * sin(Y)).
cnf(sin_diff, axiom, sin(X - Y) = sin(X) * cos(Y) - cos(X) * sin(Y)).
cnf(cos_diff, axiom, cos(X - Y) = cos(X) * cos(Y) + sin(X) * sin(Y)).
cnf(sin_double, axiom, sin('2' * X) = '2' * sin(X) * cos(X)).
cnf(cos_double, axiom, cos('2' * X) = cos(X) * cos(X) - sin(X) * sin(X)).
```

```python
%%file /tmp/vector_calc.p
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_algebra_relations
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities

cnf(dot_comm, axiom, dot(X, Y) = dot(Y, X)).
cnf(add_comm, axiom, X + Y = Y + X).
cnf(add_assoc, axiom, X + (Y + Z) = (X + Y) + Z).
cnf(dot_distrib, axiom, dot(X, Y + Z) = dot(X, Y) + dot(X, Z)).

cnf(cross_antisym, axiom, cross(X, Y) = -cross(Y, X)).

% curl div grad
```

    Writing /tmp/vector_calc.p

```python
!twee /tmp/vector_calc.p --no-color
```

    RESULT: Satisfiable (the axioms are consistent).

# Syntax, Semantics, and Cost

We often want to talk about the "cost" of a term and extract a minimal one. There are a few approachest to this.

The system can't internally differentiate between metalevel. If `x + 0 = x` for serious then `size(x + 0) = 3` and `size(0) = 1` are inconsistent. You can easily derive `3 = 1` via substitution. At the meta level we can recognize this though. So we could perhaps build our desires into the metalevel term ordering.

Another approach is to perform reflection of terms into our logic. We can make a distinction between the term `(x + 0)` and the related semantic value `sem(x + 0) = sem(x) +_sem sem(0) = x_sem +_sem 0_sem = x_sem`. We do equational reasoning on the semantic values, but can still internally talk about the cost of terms. The _terms_ `x + 0 != x` aren't equal but their semantic interpretations _are_. Then the question we want to ask is `exists T, cost(T) <= 10 & sem(T) = sem(original_term)`. We can turn down `10` until it is no longer satisfiable to get a minimal cost term.  

A related doubling approach has come up in the context of egglog when we have discussed using internal egglog functionality to program custom extraction criteria.

A function `reify : Sem -> Term` is also intriguing.

This approach does seem like it will be tough on our reasoning engine.

# Set Theory

Some aspects of set theory can be easily modelled as equational manipulations.
Not all though. The comphrehension principle is a pretty impportant part. I suspect it will be difficult to do this principle elegantly with equations.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematical_identities>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_set_identities_and_relations>

```python
%%file /tmp/set.p
cnf(union_empty, axiom, X ∪ ∅ = X).
cnf(idemp_union, axiom, X ∪ X = X).
cnf(comm_union, axiom, X ∪ Y = Y ∪ X).
cnf(assoc_union, axiom, X ∪ (Y ∪ Z) = (X ∪ Y) ∪ Z).

cnf(involution, axion, diff(X, diff(X, L)) = L).

```

    Writing /tmp/set.p

# Category Theory

An application I've been interested in for a while is category theory proof rewriting. This is kind of an offshoot of interest in functional programming and matrix expressions.

As a metasystem, we want to know that the type equations cannot be broken

GATs

```python
# tp_eqs |- t : typ
# typ_eqs |- e1 = e2 : typ
class GAT:
    t:
    typ_eqs:
```

```python
A,B,C,F,G,H = consts("A B C F G H")
id_, cod, dom, swap, dup, del_, pair, proj1, proj2 = functions("id cod dom swap dup del_ pair proj1 proj2")
axioms = [
id_(cod(F)) @ F == F,
F @ id_(dom(F)) == F,
F @ (G @ H) == (F @ G) @ H,

]
axioms


counter = 0
def tptp_axiom(axiom, name = None):
    if name == None:
        global counter
        counter += 1
        name = f"axiom{counter}"
    return f"fof({name}, axiom, {axiom})."
def tptp_axioms(axioms):
    return "\n".join(map(tptp_axiom, axioms))
print(tptp_axioms(axioms))

```

    fof(axiom1, axiom, =(@(id(cod(F)),F),F)).
    fof(axiom2, axiom, =(@(F,id(dom(F))),F)).
    fof(axiom3, axiom, =(@(F,@(G,H)),@(@(F,G),H))).

## Homotopy

path. It makes sense rewriting and homotopy/homology might be related.

<https://www.philipzucker.com/z3-and-the-word-problem/> I discussed this here.

paths are string rewriting a(b(c(X)))
homology makes the strings commutative.

```python
%%file /tmp/path.p

% simple normalization
cnf(stayput, axiom, path(A,path(A, P)) = path(A,P)).
cnf(backup, axiom, path(A,path(B, path(A, P))) = path(A, P)).

%cnf(disjoint1, axiom, a != b). % not really necessary
%cnf(disjoint2, axiom, b != c).
%cnf(disjoint3, axiom, a != c).
cnf(circle, conjecture, path(a,path(b, path(c, path(a, nil)))) = path(a,nil)).
%cnf(null_loop, conjecture, path(a, path(c,path(b, path(c, path(a, nil))))) = path(a,nil)).


```

    Overwriting /tmp/path.p

```python
!twee /tmp/path.p
```

    Here is the input problem:
      Axiom 1 (stayput): path(X, path(X, Y)) = path(X, Y).
      Axiom 2 (backup): path(X, path(Y, path(X, Z))) = path(X, Z).
      Goal 1 (circle): path(a, path(b, path(c, path(a, nil)))) = path(a, nil).
    
    1. path(X, path(X, Y)) -> path(X, Y)
    2. path(X, path(Y, path(X, Z))) -> path(X, Z)
    
    Ran out of critical pairs. This means the conjecture is not true.
    Here is the final rewrite system:
      path(X, path(X, Y)) -> path(X, Y)
      path(X, path(Y, path(X, Z))) -> path(X, Z)
    
    RESULT: CounterSatisfiable (the conjecture is false).

```python
%%file /temp/edge.p
cnf(edge, axiom, edge(a,b)).
```

Countersatisfiable means there exists a model in which this is not true.
If i ask !=, there is also a model in which it is true, which is not of interest to me. Yes.
Models is the wrong language of discussion.

# Early Termination

Give it a conjecture it can't possibly prove. There are a couple early stoppage criteria. But also if you give it a ground system it Must stop.

This ground system is an egraph.

Can I explicitly show this via the "skolemization".

Introduce a new constant for every greater than depth 1 term. These represent the eclasses
Probably KBO will rewrite to this term.
Hence the eclasses
eclass to eclass rewrites represent the union find. e1 -> e6
f(e1,e2,e3) -> e4  represent the enode f(e1,e2,e3) is in eclass e4
