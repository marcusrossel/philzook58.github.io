title: "Our Latest Ouvre: The Woodpecker"
---

Continuing the proud tradition of doing a 1-day movie for my birthday, I present to the world: The Woodpecker.

Based on the true story of Amanda's dad's battle with a woodpecker.

As always the movie morphed a bt through the production. The original ending did not work at all, nor the second one we shot.

No woodpeckers harmed in the making of this film.
