title: Notes on the TD4 4-bit CPU
---

I bought a cute little 4 bit cpu kit from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804578823017.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt) called the TD4. It has 2 registers, some LEDs, and 16 bytes of program ROM. Quite limited but still very cool and teaches a lot of principles of computer architecture.

The documentation, schematics, pictures for the computer is here <https://github.com/wuxx/TD4-4BIT-CPU>. It's a little sparse though, and I can imagine a student getting overwhelmed.

We had a blast a few years ago taking the Nand2tetris course <https://www.nand2tetris.org/> . In it, you learn how to design a computer from gates up to a small programming language. It is a good reference for background on what is going on in the TD4.

Another related option is the Ben Eater computer <https://eater.net/8bit/> . The kits are quite a bit more expensive, the cpu is more complex/powerful, and there is a lot more material.

## Building

We took two sessions just soldering it up. The image ![Alt text](/assets/td4/TD4-black-1.jpg)  plus the [schematics](https://github.com/wuxx/TD4-4BIT-CPU/blob/master/doc/cpu_td4.jpg) didn't make this conceptually too hard. ![Schematics](/assets/td4/cpu_td4.jpg). The thing that gave us the most pause was figuring out the directionality of the surface mount diodes. The thing that gave us the most trouble was soldering on the USB connector. I'd advise doing this before putting on the IC sockets, because  it got in the way of the iron. The middle pins of the USB are unconnected, so you can just blast them if need be. Which chip goes where can be seen by inspecting the schematic for part number and IC number. The notch aligns with the notch printed on the PCB board. It basically worked the first time, minus an intermittent power connection on the usb.

## How it Works

At a a high level here's how it works
![Alt text](/assets/td4/blockdiagram.png)

The ROM is the bank of 16 dip switches. This is the entirety of the program available to you, which makes it tricky to do much. Pins 5-8 of each dip switch are an opcode, selecting between `ADD`, `MOV` `IN` `OUT` `JNC` `JMP` instructions. These btis go through some cobinatorial circuit to control 1. What signal enters the addition unit 2. which register latches in the output of the addition unit. Bits 1-4 of the dip switch are the immediate value for the instruction, which is always piped into the adder.

The data selector can also select a hard wired zero signal (ground). This is for example for the `MOV A,Im` instruction. It is implemented by adding `Im` to `0` and clocking the result into `A`.

The command table has the command bits reversed from how I'd like them. The least significant bit is the low labelled one. For example, the value 3 is entered in as 1100 on the first 4 bits of the dip switch.

At a more finegrained level, here's some notes:

#### Address Decoder

The address decoder chip IC11 is a demultiplexer that takes in 4bit signal and drives the one of it's 16 output signals _low_ that corresponds to this number. When driven low, current can flow through that dip bank's diodes if the dip switch is connected. Otherwise, pullup resisrtors R21-R26 keep the signal high.

IC12 is essentially a buffering inverter circuit for the result of the ROM.

#### Command Decoder

The command bits are translated by discrtee cominbatorial logic chips in IC8 and IC10 into not_LOAD0,1,2,3 and SEL_A/SEL_B signals. Really, not_LOAD0,1,2,3 could be called not_LOADA,B,Out,PC since that is what they are hooked up to.

#### Data Selector

SEL_A and SEL_B are wired into the data selector chips IC6 and IC7. They select from 4 possible options, 00 - A, 01 - B, 10 - IN, and 11 - Zero. The Zero signal is hardwired to ground.

#### Adder

The 4 bits selected output to the Adder chip IC8, which also receives the immediate bits1-4 from the ROM bank selected. A side note, The immiedate bits are read by more instructions than might be apparent from their pneumonic. For example, `OUT B` actually still adds in the immediate. This functionality could be useful but also confusing. By default, zero out the immediate bits if you don't want them.

#### Registers

The registers A,B,Out,PC are all counter chips. Only PC has the counting functionality enabled. On the edge of the clock signal, if the not_LOAD signal is low, data will latch in from pins ABCD into the output pins QA,QB,QC,QD. JMPs are implemented by moving values into the PC register, which is fed back into the ROM address decoder.

#### Carry Flip Flop

An interesting piece is the Carry circuit which has a D flip flop for storing the overflow carry bit from the previous operation. This is needed to implement the `JNC` "jump if no carry" functionality. This operates by feeding into the command decoder circuit and disabling the LOADPC coming from the instruction if there is a carry.

Note that there appears to be a error on this version of the schematic for the command decoder. Can you find it?

#### Clock

Down in the bottom right is the clock circuit. The switches change from manual clock to auto clock and also change the clock speed. The clock is a RC controlled multivibrator. i haven't actually seriously analyzed it.

## Simple Programs

We ran a couple experimental programs.
First ots good to try something very simple.

| instruction | bit7-bit4 | bit3-bit0 | C | SEL_B  | SEL_A | #LOAD0 | #LOAD1 | #LOAD2 | #LOAD3 |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---|--------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|ADD A, Im    |0000       |Im         |X  |   L    |   L   |   L   |   H     |   H    |   H    |
|MOV A, B     |0001       |0000       |X  |   L    |   H   |   L   |   H     |   H    |   H    |
|IN  A        |0010       |0000       |X  |   H    |   L   |   L   |   H     |   H    |   H    |
|MOV A, Im    |0011       |Im         |X  |   H    |   H   |   L   |   H     |   H    |   H    |
|MOV B, A     |0100       |0000       |X  |   L    |   L   |   H   |   L     |   H    |   H    |
|ADD B, Im    |0101       |Im         |X  |   L    |   H   |   H   |   L     |   H    |   H    |
|IN  B        |0110       |0000       |X  |   H    |   L   |   H   |   L     |   H    |   H    |
|MOV B, Im    |0111       |Im         |X  |   H    |   H   |   H   |   L     |   H    |   H    |
|OUT B        |1001       |0000       |X  |   L    |   H   |   H   |   H     |   L    |   H    |

|JZ  Im       |1110       |Im         |L  |   H    |   H   |   H   |   H     |   H    |   L    |

|JMP Im       |1111       |Im         |X  |   H    |   H   |   H   |   H     |   H    |   L    |

### Output to LED

Try getting this program to work
OUT 0101

Looking up the opcode for `OUT Im` on the table it is `1011`.

This translated to the first dip switch being in `1010 1101` The first piece is the constant immediate, and the second piece is the reverse of that opcode.
![Simple output](/assets/td4/bleeps.jpg)

### Simple Flashing

Now we can try a simple blinking program with a jump.

We output two different constants and then JMP back to instruction 0

Which translates to

|asm       |  Im  | COM  |
|----------|------|------|
| OUT 0001 | 1000 | 1101 |  
| OUT 0010 | 0100 | 1101 |
| JMP 0    | 0000 | 1111 |

 ![Simple flashing](/assets/td4/bloops.jpg)

### Counting Up

Now we can trying counting

```
ADD B 1
OUT B
JMP 0
```

### Counting Down

Counting down can be done once you realize that adding 15 is the same as subtracting 1 modulo 16.
require realizing modular arithemtic

```
ADD B 15
OUT B
JMP 0
```

### Counting Up then Down

This is much trickier strangely. We screwed up a lot getting this simple program to work. In our defense we were tired. But remember to update your jump addresses, put things in the right order, manually assemble, it's a lot.

Mistakes we made
we fed will ice cream too early.
We flipped the labels going into JNC vs JMP
We had the OUT in places they couldn't be executed (at the bottom of the program)
We moved OUT after the add, destroying the carry for ADD A 1
We realized we should think of ADD B 1, OUT B a a single unit
And in fact after examing the circuit, thee two can be compressed to OUT B 1 because OUT actually takes immiedates. We lucked out that we zeroed the immedates on MOV and OUT.

Remember the program counter was 0 indexed

```
ADD B 1     1000 1010
OUT B       xxxx 1001
MOV A B     xxxx 1000
ADD A 1     1000 0000
JNC 0       0000 0111
ADD B 15    1111 1010
OUT B       xxxx 1001
MOV A B     xxxx 1000
ADD A 15    1111 0000
JNC 0       0000 0111
JMP 5       0110 1111
```

add b 1
jnc 3
jmp 5
out b
jmp 0
mov b 15
add b 15
jnc 0
out b
jmp 6

```
ADD B 1     1000 1010
OUT B       xxxx 1001
MOV A B     xxxx 1000
ADD A 1     1000 0000
JNC 0       0000 0111
ADD B 15    1111 1010
OUT B       xxxx 1001
MOV A B     xxxx 1000
ADD A 15    1111 0000
JNC 0       0000 0111
JMP 5       0110 1111
```

A different version. Using tthe idea JC ~ JNC;JMP

```
ADD B 1
JNC 3
JMP 5
OUT B
JMP 0
MOV B 15
ADD B 15
JNC 0
OUT B
JMP 6
```

## Python Assembler and Simulator

Here's a little python simulator and assembler that Ben and I wrote. Well, Ben mostly wrote.

```python

prog = """

ADD B 1
"""

{
    "ADD": "1000",
    "OUT": "1001",
    "MOV": "1010",
    "JNC": "0111",
    "JMP": "1111"
}

def assemble(x):
    op = x[0]
    match x:
        case "MOV":    
        case "ADD":
        case "OUT":
        case "JNC":
        case "JMP":
        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown op {op}")

grammar = """

    "MOV"
    "JNC"
    "OUT"
    "JMP"
    "JNC"
    "@" name

"""


```

Maybe using regex like this is a bit goofy. Maybe its nice?

```python
import re
from collections import namedtuple

from types import SimpleNamespace

instruction_regex = re.compile(r"(?P<cmd>ADD|OUT|MOV|JMP|JNC|IN) +(?P<arg1>A|B|\d{1,2})(?: +(?P<arg2>A|B|\d{1,2}))? *(?:#.*)?")

## Bits and Bobbles

It seems like there is a japanese book about this thing but I can't find a translation

Examining the schematic, looks like there is no ram to speak of, so this is a very limited machine. A + B + OUT + PC means there is 16 bits of state? Can easily exhaustively check this for anything you'd like. What about synthesizing programs?
Maybe this is good though
This is so constrained it feels more like a finite state machine.
Try model checking it?

Could I implement in python hdl or verilog or that gui thing?

subtraction
equality checking
suproptimization

Didn't Conor Mcbride have a 4 bit cpu videos?
Are there actually 4-bit cpu ou there like this?

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-bit_computing>

What interesting programs can be written? Toughy.

Model each chip

```verilog
module ALU()

end

module ROM()
end


`def JMP 0

module Computron()
    reg [3:0] A;
    reg [3:0] B;
    reg [3:0] OUT;
    reg [3:0] PC;
    

end

module HC153(in[4], out[16]); // demultiplexer
    

endmodule;

```

74HC154 - Address decoder - 4 - 16 line decoder / demultiplexer. The four incoming signals are translated to 16 mutually exclusive outputs. For example in the inputs pins are LLHH will draw pin 3 of the output _low_.  Because of all the diodes, only current will flow in through the ROM switches when that bank is enabled by bing drawn low

The two enable pins are drawn down to ground so that output is always enabled.

The lines come into this decode and select which flipy floppr is drawn

74HC540 is an inverting buffer.
