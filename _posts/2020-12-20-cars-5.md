We've been talking about making Cars 5 since at least FP1 (somewhere before 2017).
I was scared, but we successfully defended the emergent tradition of making a movie for my birthday. This is our most special effects heavy movie.
The day started out tough. We were really lost about what the plot was going to be, all we knew is that we wanted faces on cars. It turned out great though! Will nearly crapped his pants. We hit his tickle button.
