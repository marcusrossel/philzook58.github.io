    "title: Compiling With Constraints\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of interesting little subproblems in compilation like [instruction selection](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:951540/FULLTEXT01.pdf), [register allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation) and [instruction scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_scheduling). These can be expressed in declarative interlinked way to constraint solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been fiddling with probably 6 iterations of using constraint solvers for compiler backends over the last 3 years and never written a blog post on it. This is long over due, and still highly imperfect. I have found this post only gets harder to write and my standards rise. Write early, write often.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Register allocation is the backend problem most obviously castable as a constraint problem. It is often described as a variant of graph coloring (there are nuances [like coalescing](https://c9x.me/compile/bib/irc.pdf)).  [Graph coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) selects a color for each vertex in a graph such that no edge connects two nodes of the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a toy implementation over a single SSA block using z3. [Traversing backwards](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33080799) through a block is a useful trick to analyze [liveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-variable_analysis) while you're also building constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this collection, you can also emit any constraints that are opcode specific. Some instructions like the [`mul`](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/mul) instruction in x86 do not work on every kind of register. You can also collect up specific objective functions, for example biasing `mov` to go between the same registers. Spilling to the stack can be modelled by pseudo registers that you put a lot of weight on. Requiring the input or output parameters follow any calling convention is again a simple extra constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple blocks can be linked together in the same constraint solve by sharing variables. This may require packing in extra `mov` instructions between blocks to keep the problem solvable in general. See this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02452.pdf) for more\n"

    "## Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "One might think the advantage of compiling with constraints is getting perfectly optimized solutions. I have found this to not be the case. Heuristic solutions to these problems are fast and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage to compiling with constraints is that it short, declarative and rapidly flexible. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also is another attack on the phase ordering problem, similar to the pitch for [egraphs](https://egraphs.org/). The phase ordering problem is that these compiler phases are interlinked, so there are uncomfortable compromises made in serializing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly for me its just fun though. I like solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distinction To Superoptimization\n",
    "[Superoptimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoptimization) as I'll define it today is taking the semantics of assembly instructions, the semantics of your host program, making the constraint that they match and tossing it into a solver. This is vastly over simplified. Any even remotely pragmatic approach prunes the search space significantly using domain specific techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between this and compiling with constraints is that compilation with constraints does not take a deep semantical perspective. The deep semantics are encoded in the instruction selection table, the generation of which I am not commenting on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiling with constraints is largely concerned only with the dependency relationship of operands and instructions. This is a more tractable abstraction than the full instruction semantics. It also can be viewed as taking a traditional compiler pipeline and making it more declarative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superoptimization traditionally scales very poorly. Compiling with constraints could feasibly be done at a much larger more practical scale as the Unison compiler showed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# VIBES and Minizinc\n",
    "\n",
    "I first started on the VIBES project https://github.com/draperlaboratory/VIBES . The hypothesis there was that binary patching requires unusual constraints and that superoptimization like abilities may make the difference between patching in place or requiring detours. These two cases are very different tiers of complexity and error-proneness. The situation in [micropatching](https://www.philipzucker.com/permutation_compile/) also is for very small programs, for which the slowness of constraint compiling is not an issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal was highly inspired by the [Unison](https://unison-code.github.io/) compiler (not the distributed system one). You can find our [minizinc](https://www.minizinc.org/) model here https://github.com/draperlaboratory/VIBES/blob/main/resources/minizinc/model.mzn . It is a simplified form of the constraint model from Unison.\n",

    "Ultimately I think there were multiple problems with the approach. The choice of serialization of our data structures to and from minizinc was very painful. It has been asked before why we didn't use Z3. The answer is we were sticking close to the Unison design (we actually initially wanted to literally reuse [their model](https://github.com/unison-code/unison/blob/master/src/solvers/multi_backend/minizinc/code-generation.mzn), but it was completely incomprehensible to me after some weeks of trying to decrypt it), and that \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end I don't believe this hypothesis was born out and we would have been better served by a more traditional compiler architecture. We became ensnared in the implementation issues of talking to the constraint solver and the concepts of the model were too rigid and complicated to explain easily to others or modify when inevitable surprises popped up. Live and learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "That these data structures were not easily hand editable or all that readable (they were json, but gobs of complicated json) was a huge impediment to development and debugging when my bandwidth was already strapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "A not fully explored alternative was using a shallow embedding instead to encode the problem over to minizinc. Minizinc does not have good support for syntax trees as objects. However, it does support functions. So the idea was that instead of serializing to a pile of arrays, instead one can pretty print a program that looks like a relational representation of the program. This representation is immediately interpreted to constraint in the finally tagless style using minizinc function definitions.\n",

    "Unison is an alternative LLVM backend that solves the register allocation problem and instruction selection problem in \"unison\" using a constraint solving backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unison supported multiple architectures, but one, [Hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Hexagon) was a [very long instruction word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word) (VLIW) architecture. My 10cent discussion of VLIW is that the instruction set allows explicit specification of parallelism / data dependencies. This enables perhaps a more direct model of the actual parallel interworkings of the cpu at the cost of significant compiler complexity. It is here that perhaps constraint compilation carries its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is particular is useful [Combinatorial Register Allocation and Instruction Scheduling])<https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02452>). Also very interesting was the [manual](https://unison-code.github.io/doc/manual.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLVM has multiple IRs. One of them is [Machine IR](https://llvm.org/docs/MIRLangRef.html) (MIR), which is an IR that has more of the information filled in. Unison takes this output, fiddles with it, and then performs solving. This reuses the frontend, middle end passes, and instruction selection of llvm, which is huge.\n",

Is represented too weak a word for this question which seems to be very important? \"BIL\" represented as a sequence vs as a graph might as well be nearly entirely different things. It seems totally possible to translate between pure and imperative, and between the representations and yet it matters so much. What is the output language. It structurally isn't concrete assembly in many ways. It is definitely un-register allocated and probably unsequenced. Sometimes it feels like tree-like quasi assembly, where the node represents an \"output\" register even though assembly is really just a sequence of effects.
