    "title: An External Z3 Egraph for Egraphs Modulo Theories\n",
    "date: 2024-07-07\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "`EMT = SMT - SAT`\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfiability Modulo Theories is basically SAT + Egraph + bits of other things like linear programming. The egg paper ematching algorithm is based off the one described for z3. Even if it isn't intended for the use case, one feels like the z3 egraph and ematcher would be mighty convenient thing for equality saturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it has a been a source of sadness for a long time that SMT solvers hold all sorts of bits and pieces that can't be easily abused off label.\n",
    "[Z3](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/logic/intro/) is super engineered and has bindings everywhere. It's a great platform, but I understand the project has it's own goals and desires that may not comply with whatever fancy I have for the next 15 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I've been thinking about it, and there is a pretty tight little implementation of an external egraph made possible by the z3 ast functions exposed, in particular `substitute` which can replace ground terms by other grounds terms in an expression. We can use this to build a [Ground Rewrite System style egraph](https://www.philipzucker.com/egraph2024_talk_done/). Adding to this the technique of bottom up e-matching, we can search over our egraph and assert theory specific constraints into the system and use them as guards (for disequality constraints or linear inequality constraints). We can also reuse the built in z3-simplifier, which can be quite handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we can make cached functions that tells us the size of a term and a function that returns terms in some term order. This is sort of a half-assed knuth bendix term order that tie breaks equal sized terms by the effectively random term id. I'm not so sure this cowboy term ordering is ok, so maybe implementing a real [ground knuth bendix ordering](https://www.philipzucker.com/ground_kbo/) is in order\n"
