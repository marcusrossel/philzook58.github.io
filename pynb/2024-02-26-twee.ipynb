    "When I was more focussed on physics, basically all mathematics was equational manipulation. The generic facilities of sympy and mathematica fall into this category (they also have massive piles of domain specific smarts about odes, pdes, special functions, etc).\n",

    "[Twee](https://nick8325.github.io/twee/) is an off the shelf equational prover that is underutilized in this arena. You can install it, get readable equational proofs out, and have it generate unknown desired terms.\n",

    "Here is an [example](https://github.com/nick8325/twee/blob/master/tests/deriv.p ) of it using an equational specification of differentiation to derive an antiderivative.\n",

    "This shows using twee for derivatives. It's very impressive in my opinion. The proof output is quite clean and it also returns the instantiation of the exponential. in this manner, twee is an antidifferentiation engine."

    "At it's core, equational proof search is not that complicated in principle. You are given an initial term to start out with and you are seeking some goal term.

You could apply all the regular depth first, breadth first, A*, Beam etc search algorithms.\n",

Most automated equational manipulation in the world is greedy rewriting of this form.\n",

    "One of the appeals of pure functional programming a la Haskell is that you can manipulate programs with pen and paper as you would an algebraic expression. With a simple manipulation you can express loop rearrangements that are rather complex. This is analogous in some respects to manipulating matrix expressions. The associativity of matrix multiplication is actually a somewhat complicated loop rearragement too. \n",

At the meta level we can recognize this though. So we could perhaps build our desires into the metalevel term ordering.\n",

    "Another approach is to perform reflection of terms into our logic. We can make a distinction between the term `(x + 0)` and the related semantic value `sem(x + 0) = sem(x) +_sem sem(0) = x_sem +_sem 0_sem = x_sem`. We do equational reasoning on the semantic values, but can still internally talk about the cost of terms. The _terms_ `x + 0 != x` aren't equal but their semantic interpretations _are_. Then the question we want to ask is `exists T, cost(T) <= 10 & sem(T) = sem(original_term)`. We can turn down `10` until it is no longer satisfiable to get a minimal cost term.  \n",
