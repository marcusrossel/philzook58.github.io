    "title: Bottom Up Egraph Ematching Plays Nicer with Theories (AC, etc)\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that is an open problem in the [egraph community](https://egraphs-good.github.io/) is how to cleanly integrate domain specific information / normalizing rewrite systems / algorithms cleanly with egraph rewriting. AC, lambda, graphs, cheap arithmetical reasoning are all quite desirable. \n",
    "\n",
    "I claim that \"bottom up\" ematching makes it easier to think about these things. It is by fair the simplest way to do ematching and has some good properties with regards to theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Pattern Matching: top down, bottom up, side to side\n",
    "### Top Down Ematching\n",
    "In much of the [literature](https://leodemoura.github.io/files/ematching.pdf), a top down ematcher is described. You start with a pattern `foo(bar(X),Y) -> biz(X)` and an eclass `e1`. One looks for an enode with symbol `foo` in eclass `e1`, for which there may be many `e1 = foo(e2,e3), e1 = foo(e4,e5), ...`. \n",
    "For each of these possibilities, you recursively ematch with the subpatterns `bar(X)` and `Y`.\n",
    "The deeper the pattern, the more nondeterministic search it will expose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of seeking a query pattern over a database of terms/eclasses, other possibilities become reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in top down ematching for all eclasses, you do not really have a starting `e1` to work with. You also _first_ do a top level scan over the whole egraph to find all the possible `e1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational Ematching\n",
    "A general perspective is that of [relational ematching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02290) which allows many possibilities of pattern expansion direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational ematching's non opinion about join ordering is both a strength and weakness. Perhaps you can build a good query planner, but where should you start?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bottom Up Ematching\n",
    "\n",
    "An underdiscussed method is that of _bottom up_ ematching. It is incredibly simple, even simpler than top down.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you guess the leaves (the variables). In other words, for each variable, you have a scan over all possible eclasses. Then just construct the eclass by hash table lookup and see if that term if it in the egraph already.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search over the variables is quite reminiscent of the worst case optimal join algorithm GJ ([see figure 2b](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10841.pdf)).  It is also reminsicent of how people write [send-more-money puzzles](https://blog.jle.im/entry/unique-sample-drawing-searches-with-list-and-statet) using the non determinism monad.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# (rewrite (foo (bar X) Y) -> (biz X))\n",
    "for X in eclasses:\n",
    "    for Y in eclasses:\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            lhs = foo[bar[X], Y]  # possibly failing lookup in hashcons\n",
    "            rhs = biz(X)          # construct rhs\n",
    "            egraph.union(lhs,rhs) # set equal\n",
    "        except e:\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On first glance, this feels extremely wasteful. Scans are \"expensive\" and every nesting of them costs asymptotically more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are big payoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Very simple. \n",
    "2. Less indices are needed. You only need the most minimal hash consing lookup behavior. You do not need to expand eclasses to enodes.\n",
    "3. No non determinism while traversing the pattern. Depth does not really matter.\n",
    "4. You already pay at least 1 scan in top down. If you only have 1 variable, bottom up is definitely better and YMMV for more variables\n",
    "5. Possibly more parallelizable / gpuable because it's so simple (?).\n",
    "6. Easily written as an idiom. You can hand tweak you loops. Change the ordering of variable expansion, maybe prune by Sort, lift common subexpressions out to fail early. Your host language understands loops quite well and might do some of this for you. Reminds me of [datafrog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-05-19.md) A demonstration of [loop invariant code motion / hoisting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion) for patterns:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for X in eclasses:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        t1 = bar[X] # This can be lifted into higher loop\n",
    "        for Y in eclasses:\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                lhs = foo[t1, Y]  # possibly failing lookup in hashcons\n",
    "                rhs = biz(X)          # construct rhs\n",
    "                egraph.union(lhs,rhs) # set equal\n",
    "            except:\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "    except:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. During pattern matching you have ground terms to work with. This property I claim gives better theory integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theories\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason bottom up ematching is better for theories is because you immediately ground everything. Ground things are much easier to normalize than things with variables still in them. During top-down or relational ematching, the pattern gets partially filled in and you a still left with chunks of patterns that may have variables in them. A set or multiset for example are easily normalized by sorting its list representation. Or you can use a trie or some other data structure. See python's [`frozenset`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20832279/python-frozenset-hashing-algorithm-implementation) and the discussion by [Ricard O'Keefe How to Hash a Set](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201710.0192/v1/download). More on this some other day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't exactly have a ground term because the leaf pattern variables have eclasses filled in. But you do have enough structure exposed that you can typically easily normalize. Sort of you have done a partial extraction, so this is perhaps related to the \"extract, normalize, reinsert\" method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Small Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An egraph ~ union find + hash cons, so first we need a union find. Path compression and balancing are not important for correctness, only for performance so I'll ignore them. I'll make an aside that path compression is actually the source of many conceptual problems and keeping an uncompressed copy is the start of having a [proof producing](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~roberto/papers/rta05.pdf) union find."
