    "# Automata Minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical sense that these streams are equivalent is that they observationally equivalent and they can be compacted via automata minimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time, I described how naive automata minimization works https://www.philipzucker.com/naive_automata/ . The key point is that states are only meaningfully distinct if they have distinct observations. We can operationalize this as a dictionary `dict[stateid, Obs]` and compress the dictionary in a simple loop, iteratively refining a partition of the state ids into a coarsest partition that cannot be observationally split.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're entrenched in such things, this is reminiscent of the process of egraph rebuilding. This was noted in the tree automata analogy work, more on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automata minimization can be used as the analog of hash consing for rational loopy data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Egraphs themselves are \"just\" a hashcons++, a hash cons mixed with a union find. They are represented as the combination of a table `dict[ENode, Eid]` and a unionfind. This table tells us how to evaluate expressions in the current model. It is very much the analog of a table saying how to perform multiplication in a finite group `add_mod2 = {(1,0):1, (1,1):0, (0,0):0, (0,1):1}; inv_mod2 = {1 : 1, 0 : 0}; id_mod2 = {() : 0}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monotonicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Equality saturation is monotonically discovering new well formed terms and increasing the equalities known (these equalities in turn _shrink_ the data structure through compaction, but it's best not to think about that from a semantic meaning perspective). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the point that stumped me for a long time, as trivial as it will sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "The direction of monotonicity that works for observations is that we can _forget_ observations, make fewer and fewer distinctions. If we are \"_learning_\" new observations about state, we need to split two state that may already have been merged as equivalent by automata minimization. We could perhaps do this, but then state \"equality\" via minimization becomes meaningless as it can always end up being reversed, and we can't compress away states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution of this conundrum is that the observation table has to be partial and that the keys that are not in the observation table are not _unobserved_, the are _unexpanded_. They are in fact _maximally_ observed, as in they have unique identity. We may choose to \"seal\"/\"close\" a state at a later point, perhaps via a rule, saying it will have no more observations possible than those in the observation record.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the observations include a term that will have new equalities discovered that's fine. That does not constitute a disruption of the \"sealing\". `1 -> Obs(a + b)` and `2 -> Obs(b + a)` but upon discovery of `a + b = b + a`, the two observations become equivalent and the two states can be seen to be equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we can make a combined data structure consisting of an `enode` table, a union find, and an observation table. I call this data structure a co-egraph."
