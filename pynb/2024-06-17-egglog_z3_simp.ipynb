    "title: Conditional Simplification of Z3py Expressions with Egglog\n",
    "date: 2024-06-17\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 offers `simplify`, which is really really useful. But it only works with the built in z3 rewrite rules, which are not contextual. It would be awesome to be able to add user defined rewrite rules or rewrite under solver contexts. There may be some kind of way to use a solver to get contextual rewriting but I'm not sure. There are some tactics discussed here\n",
    "https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/programming/Example%20Programs/Formula%20Simplification/ but also caleb did some hacky workarounds (he put a dummy variable in and then rooted around for it. \"all it's doing really is making a fresh variable v, setting v == expr_to_simplify, run the simplification then search through the constraints for v\" ) https://github.com/draperlaboratory/cozy/blob/c955d6add00bc712775516f02ee6fdd6c10d3f7a/cozy/claripy_ext.py#L10\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious thing that shows up is simplification of array expressions, which are the compounding of many stores and loads. This sort of thing shows up in symbolic execution all the time. If the addresses of the stores and loads are symbolic, you need contextual aliasing info to know which ones commutes and cancel with each other. Otherwise you're just stuck a a big long mess of an expression. This was one of my egglog0 examples https://www.philipzucker.com/egglog0/ and also an example I wrote in egglog https://egraphs-good.github.io/egglog/?example=array I think it was Evy that brought this idea up to me in between my meltdowns at chris leaving. It's a good one.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was getting into a quagmire of building my own AST for knuckledragger https://github.com/philzook58/knuckledragger which was roughly similar to Z3's python AST but under my control.  But now I am back to thinking  a cleverer design is to just heavily piggy back on z3 even if I'm not always calling z3 itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z3py api is a de facto standard and I think it ultimately has fewer warts than merits. CVC5 has built a pythonic api to mimic it https://cvc5.github.io/docs/cvc5-1.0.2/api/python/pythonic/pythonic.html which I can hopefully just swap in. I consider pysmt to be basically unusable (sorry) because they diverged from this api.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saul has been making the egglog python bindings https://egglog-python.readthedocs.io/latest/ taking a very meta highly integrated approach. I kind of just want it to look like z3 though. It's very interesting and I'm haunted by the idea that I am a stodgy old man and they're right. I think it's biggest demerit is that it is very novel. I've never seen an interface like it. From a research perspective this is a plus. It is very cool that they are getting the python typechecker and the embedded dsl to play ball. I dunno https://egraphs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/375765-egg.2Fegglog/topic/egglog.20python.20midlevel.20api/near/421919681\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out, it is simple enough to have my cake too. The pyegglog supports the raw bindings and I've been spending a decent amount of time serializing Z3 ASTs to other smt or tptp solvers. Translating to egglog programs is easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be a nice approach for tools already integrated with z3 such as angr.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had hoped it would be as easy as `t.sexpr()` but egglog's sexpr and smtlibs are not compatible. Still, not so bad. There is a lot of elbow grease left to proabbly clean this up to actually working but it gets the idea out there."
